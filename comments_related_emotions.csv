funny movies recommend,T2hFpxIMXwM,"I've read the book that the first movie is based on. It was absolutely hilarious, I think the book is called ""Can you keep a secret?"" by Sophie Kinsella."

funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Thank you so much
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,thanks man
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8, @It’s Chris  it’s mentioned during Shaun Of The Dead
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Dodgeball is one of the most underrated comedy movies. Definitely should have at least been an honorable mention.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,I agree
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,old school is not on here as well
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Blade, Lazer.............Blazer"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Yeah they should have dropped Wet Hot American Summer for Dodgeball IMO.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Sam thing with austin powers
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Old school, meet the parents are missing"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Agreed
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8, @Ehouse33  travesty that movie was hilarious. Will Ferrell was hilarious. Every time I hear Dust in the Wind I think of Old School.  You're my boy Blue
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Definitely agree along with Anchorman.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,My favorite movie of all time
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"""The Other Guys"" is seriously underrated. That movie deserves at least an honorable mention! AT LEAST!"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,I am a peacock you gotta let me fly !!
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Got to have little river band on
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Other guys isn’t underrated. Ok it wasn’t on the list that doesn’t mean underrated.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Products of cheap high industrial pickup ornamental
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Boring movie
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,True
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,it should be second or third imo
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Looks like Scarface sneezed on your car
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Bye Shiela
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,I love The Nice Guys. Have watched it twice. The chemistry of all characters is flawless in the movie. This really strange yet comedic movie deserved the honorable mention.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Tropic Thunder is the movie that solidified RDJ as one of the greatest actors of all time for me
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Seriously
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Watch more movies
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Being an Indian even I approve the fact!!
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Stannis The Mannis as a person who’s movie range spans from The Godfather to Halloween to Rocky, I’m pretty sure I’m well rounded. But thanks for your opinion on my life"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Kahlil Pittman so you really think he’s anywhere near Brando, Day Lewis, Olivier, De Niro, Pacino etc?"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Lmao! Not even close. Rdj is a average actor.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Stannis The Mannis have you not seen any of his earlier movies?
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Kahlil Pittman yes and he’s fine but no where near being an all time great. He can’t even touch the best of today (DiCaprio and Phoenix)
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Stannis The Mannis explain why you don’t think he’s great
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Kahlil Pittman doesn’t have the range, screen presence, natural ability that can’t be taught, can’t carry an average/mediocre film etc"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Mine is Office Space, since I can 90% relate to that. Relating to a movie and bringing it to comedy makes it my#1."

funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Me

funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Everyone
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Syaufi Shaharuddin me I saw every movie you can think of I’m really bored
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Well the search was what is best movie in Netflix
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Watch the Gentlemen movie it's amazing
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Syaufi Shaharuddin yup lol
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,We needed this during this time. Talladega Nights should have been top 15 but to not even get an honorable mention is questionable at best.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Nico Cusimano eh. It’s funny but not as good as step brothers or anchorman
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,This Is The End is a cultural masterpiece. I can watch it over and over. Love Jay Baruchel but the one that makes this movie great is Danny McBride.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Notable omissions: Talladega Nights, Wedding Crashers, Old School, Life Aquatic, and Scott Pilgrim. Also, I would have put Hot Fuzz in over Shaun (I actually find SotD to be the weakest of the Cornetto Trilogy, though still damn great!)"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,I prefer Hot Fuzz as well
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8," @106andie  Hot Fuzz gives me a headache, Shaun of the Dead all day every day"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Thanks guys....we needed this list to binge watch in these times
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,You know that.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Preach

funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Thanks brother
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Loyal
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Weed is a false sense of peace and Heaven turn back to Jesus Christ I'm no saint I quit weed 70 day's ago and cigarettes. I relapsed with the porn and masturbation after 47 day's clean and than fell again I'm now 49 day's clean  from EVERYTHING.   All glory to God .. I used to chief  all the time Blunts papers bongs all different types of Way's.  I felt God's love before and it's greater than weed you won't feel it all the time but one day you will for eternity no matter life's stresses and hardships to know you'll finally be home is the greatest feeling.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8," @Jeshurun.144k  Sounds like weed isn't your problem bro.  Weed is literally medicine to millions.  You got darker demons than weed, and no magic sky sorcerer is going to fix that.  Just get a therapist.  Same thing."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,I’m definitely going with This Is The End. I don’t think any movie has made me laugh harder. The Nice Guys is close though too.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,John C. Reilly was comic gold in the 2000s. Happy to see they put Walk Hard on this list
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"I loved LITERALLY everything about this list... but I feel that instead of School of Rock, Nacho Libre would've been better. I'm the biggest fan of Jack Black and I cannot tell you how much of a cult classic Nacho Libre has on the youth and even the adult side. But this list? Way to go Watch Mojo... you too Rebecca from watch mojo"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,the wolf of wall street is not categorized as a comedy but  its funny as hell
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Drama/Comedy
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Leaving out Wedding Crashers is unforgivable
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,...... I'm watching the list.... now.. .... are you fucking...KIDDING ME.....
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8, @Flipo  1999 bro
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8, @christopher Mennell  you mean 2005.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"There are most certainly two that belong on this list far more than stoner films:  Dale and Tucker vs. Evil, and Rat Race."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,DALE AND TUCKER VS. EVIL IS SO GOOD! I forgot about it thanks for reminding me!
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"I like the list, but Kung Fu Hustle and Scott Pilgrim deserve a spot on this list."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Kung fu hustle was amazing
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8, @Kidd Isley  I forgot Idiocracy too! It should be on the list.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,I agree kung Fu panda is a masterpiece
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8," @Duncan Buckets  kung fu hustle, not panda."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Shaolin soccer too
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8, @Some Medic  is that the sequel?
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8," @Duncan Buckets  kung-fu hustle and kung fu panda are two different movies all together. One is produced by an Asian director, I think in Hong Kong, the other is American."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Funny not a single Kevin Hart, Adam Sandler, or Jim Carrey film on the list lol"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Great list, also loved Carell’s, The Incredible Burt Wonderstone."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"As with just about every one of these Mojo lists that I've watched on YT, this one is maddening for some of its inclusions, exclusions, and rankings.  And, also keeping up tradition, what makes this list particularly irritating for me is that it DOES include a good number of my favorite comedies of that time block, which gives it credibility I can't easily repudiate; YET, I almost feel ashamed for agreeing with a good number of their choices, so annoyed am I with the aforementioned issues I have with it.  Ok, I must pick a bone here that I find wildly off the mark - the inclusion of the WILDLY overrated (by some) Napoleon Dynamite, and the complete shut out/oversight of the similarly oddball/eccentric Hot Rod, which I would absolutely rank among my 20 favorite comedies of ALL TIME.  Sorry, but I will always see ND as a movie that was swept up in a wave of hype that I still find difficult to comprehend, to this day.  The pacing was soooo leaden, and the characters were all one dimensional, anthropomorphized quirks, rather than believable human beings.  It is an odd movie, to say the least.  It just isn't genuinely funny.  Hot Rod, on the other hand, is hysterical.  It's one of a relatively small group of comedies which contain one or more scenes that had me literally gasping for oxygen, so hard was I laughing.  Sure, the motivations and actions could be seen as possessing an off-kilter, almost surreal eccentricity which in a sense can be seen as similar to that of ND, but the similarity ends there.  Hot Rod benefits hugely from its brilliant cast, filled with hilarious actors and comic conceptualists like Andy Samberg, Bill Hader, Will Arnette, and Danny McBride.  Damn, I've gone on waaay too long already.  If you haven't seen Hot Rod, just do it.  Watch it at least two or three times, just so you make sure you give it a chance, when you are in the right mood.  On first viewing, I liked it, but the second time was a revelation, for some reason.Oh, great work, Mojo people, choosing Tropic Thunder, a real contender for my all time favorite comedy, but then you went and fumbled it on the  five yard line by slating it at number eleven!  Way too low!  That movie is a layered, brilliant, amazingly hilarious work of cinematic art!  Robert Downey, Jr. gave a performance for the ages in what would have been a massively demanding role; everyone involved (yes, Tom Cruise and Matthew McConaughey both do hilarious work) did great, stunningly funny work.  Oh, and I can barely praise Justin Theroux and Ben Stiller enough for one of the smartest, funniest, and most inventive screenplays I've ever encountered.  Damn, I love that movie!Beyond that, I think Anchorman was a laudable number one pick - it's certainly in my top three, at least - and I strongly agree about Zoolander, Shaun of the Dead, and 40 Year Old Virgin, as well.  Really, I would have made room for Talladega Nights and Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, but it was a good list, overall.  Oh, hold on - Wedding Crashers was fantastic!  Where was that?  Must give this more thought... I'll let myself out.  Bye, now.  (Minutes later): I hadn't looked at other comments before I posted, and now that I have, I just want to add my vote for The Other Guys, which is incredible on a number of levels, too.  That's one hilarious movie, and Wahlberg was SO great!  I loved that he was not the straight man, really; he was the really the super pissed off man, and was so funny delivering his uncontained rage that he actually came off as even funnier than Ferrell, though it was close.  ""I'm a peacock - you gotta let me fly!""  Awesome movie!!!"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Never has a movie made me laugh as much as Borat. It is in my opinion the best comedy movie ever.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,“I look like something you give your kid when you tell them grandma died” -Ted
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Pretty good list, but Super Troopers should be #1 and Role Models needs to be top 10."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"We're The Millers, 2013 is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, it should be on the list.  I haven't met anyone who has seen it who hasn't thought it was one of the best comedies they have ever seen.  It is an overlooked movie."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,I've seen 5 movies on this list and only liked 3 of them. I love Napoleon Dynamite. That's one of the best movies ever.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,I feel that Wedding Crashers should've at least been in the honorable mentions don't ya think?
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"I actually called the top three, with Anchorman as 1.  As proud as I feel, I am humbled about Ross Tanenbaum below me.  He is so right."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"I love #17, #11, Zombieland, and #1. But I’m a little surprised We’re The Millers didn’t make the list."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Overall good list. A few I’m not a huge fan of personally. I would have liked to have seen Dodgeball on this list as well though.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Johnny English should be included in the honourable mention.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Anchorman Probably my favorite movie of all time. I was expecting it to be at like the 15-10 slot though. Then I started watching and it hadn’t showed up. By #2 I was like “fine ok it’ll get an honorable mention”. Then I saw it at 1. I flipped out
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Salute to all the Paul Rudd on this list, including the awesome Brian Fantana at #1! "
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,The Johnny English series is damn hilarious....
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Harold and Kumar and a Grandma’s Boy should definitely be on this list!
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Four Lions is one of the most underrated comedy movies. If you think The Dictator is great, you’ve not seen Four Lions"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"The facts this list doesn’t have Wedding Crashers or Old School on it, I can’t take it seriously. SMDH!!"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"No doubt in my mind that modern classics like Borat, Step Brothers & Anchorman would be on the list but to put Zoolander at such a low spot as #10 is a minor travesty. However it's nice to see movies like Budapest Hotel & Shaun of The Dead on the list, really loved the style of Budapest and Shaun is a classic that you can watch a couple of times a year without getting tired of it."
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Which comedy pleasantly surprised you the most?
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"Sausage Party. It was ridiculously inappropriate, but way funnier than I thought it would be."
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,2 days ago
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Due Date is an underrated classic
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Paddington
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Me 21 and 22 jump street
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,White chicks definitely white chicks. The wayans brothers haven't exactly made a whole bunch of movies that i've enjoyed but i was so surprised at how funny and enjoyable white chicks was. I'm writing this as i paused the video during the honourable mentions. Let's see what's number 1.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Also easy a love that one. I thought it was going to be very formulaic it was not. And the parents were super hillarious.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Midnight express
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Zombieland. I love the movie so much!!!!
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Hitman's Bodyguard. I definitely wasn't prepared for how funny that movie was.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Great list. I was well and truly surprised by 21 jump street when I first saw it. I was laughing so hard watching it.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"Game Night is one of the best comedies released in the 2010s.  The cast's chemistry is great, and the jokes hold up to multiple viewings."
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,10. Game night09. The 40year old vergin08. Beetle  juice07. Zombie land06. Girls trip05. Mean girls04. 21 Jump street03. Harold and Kumar go to white castle02. Jumanji:welcome to the jungle (2017)01. Napoleon Dynamite
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Thanks
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Yes
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Spoilers
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Haven’t seen Girl’s Trip or Game Night or Mean Girls but I love the rest
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Merci
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg, @Amelia C  huh?
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg, @Tech2000  u gotta watch mean girls it’s a classic
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Thanks mate
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Thanks
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,mad respect
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,So no one's talking about how super bad isn't on the list
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Was thinking it was gonna be number one:(
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Wow cant believe that wasnt on the list. It's an instant classic.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,I thought it was overrated and pretty tone deaf
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,I feel like that one was expected to be good
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,List is unexpected funny movies. Superbad was advertised as comedy but definitely surpassed any expectations
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Brynden Rivers lol how is it tone deaf? It’s like the exact opposite of tone deaf. It’s by far the most realistic depiction of what high school is actually like.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"It was after 40 year old virgin, it's made by same folks, so expection was high"
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,I know right that movie is funny as shit
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,One of the best comedies
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"It’s because everyone knew it was going to be good. After the success of The 40-year Old Virgin, everyone knew Judd Apatow’s next movie was gonna be awesome"
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,I’ve never laughed harder than the first time I saw 21 jump street. I tricked my dad into taking me because he didn’t know it was rated R and as a 12 year old it was awesome. That will truly go down as a classic.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Im happy to see Game Night get recognition! Absolutely hilarious ride!
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Loved it!
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,We are the Millers had me and the wife rolling. Never expected it to be as funny as it was. Bridesmaids was piss yourself funny too.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,I remember laughing a lot during We are the Millers!  I'll have to watch it again!
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,what? it sucks
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"Hot tub time machine had absolutely no reason to be as good as it was, yet there we are"
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,It’s SO STUPID XC watched it like 8 times
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Well the cast is mostly comedians so I did see it coming..and I do love it as well
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,👍 agreed
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,It was alright
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,“Dad I’m a lesbian” holds her hand “What does your mom think” killed me
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Dumb ? What show is that
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg," @RAIDER T  ""the blockers""   her dad knew it already...."
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,I even kenw it before she came out blockers is funny ass movie
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg," @Rohit Chabukswar  he didn't know....he just accepted it, since he'd been trying to find a way to get closer/get connection with her, he let it be.....then knowing his mom doesn't know yet, he was thrilled she finally let him in, was the first to know/they're special moment"""
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg, @version2media  watch the  movie again ...
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg," @version2media  don't know if you speak the language, but her dad specifically told the other parents on atleast 2 separate occasions that he was very aware of the fact that his daughter was gay."
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,How is the hangover not #1. No one expected that hit to be made.. crazy
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Or Superbad
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,That wasn't the title of the video. They had an all star cast. I see certain actors & I just assume the movie will be good.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg, @Chechino  what? Superbad was getting credit just from the trailers. Everyone knew it was gonna be hilarious
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"As always, awesome list! At first I was thinking to myself, ""self, I can't even think of ten movies that exceeded my expectations."" However, you guys are all very good at what you do and hit 10 nails directly on the head! I'm even willing  to bet that you can make more lists with the same subject. Keep up the good work!"
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"Napoleon Dynamite is a classic, seeing those clips gave me nostalgia"
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,The first time I caught you within minutes
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,since no one said it yet and someone has to do itwhy are you everywhere?
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg," @JM Uchiha  I meanTechnically, the guy above you recognized him"
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Hii again  you are everywhere  i go.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Napoleon dynamite is one worst movies ive seen its boring not funny
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Really?  That movie made me cringe watching it... It literally made me embarrassed to be of the same species as those who made the film and acted in it
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,That movie sucks
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Am I the only person on planet earth that DIDNT think napoleon dynamite was funny. I respect its influence and such but it never once made me laugh.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg, @TCY  i dont think its funny ethier its boring i give it a 1 because of the dance scene
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"I'm surprised Mean Girls wasn't at least in the top 3, there are countless meme pages that quote the movie and a lot of people still use Tina Fey's iconic lines from the film in real life. Not to mention it was such a hit that it got a spot on Broadway"
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Not funny
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,There are countless meme pages that quote Will Ferrel movies. Even tho they are not funny.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"To me, the 40 year old virgin will always be the perfect type of comedy because it tells such a strong and touching story that also has hilarious jokes which aren’t meant to be superior to the narrative"
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Also the non-scripted waxing scene makes this movie ever better.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,I was really impressed by Game Night. My husband and I were surprised at how well it turned out.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"Where was ""The Hangover""?  Made on a budget of 35 million dollars that film came out of literally nowhere. It looked like nothing special in the trailers but what we got was a hilarious comedy that found the right balance of situational humor, raunchiness, and dark humor. It made stars out of Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifinakis, and Ken Jeong, grossed 467 million dollars worldwide, and even won a deserved golden globe award for best picture (Musical or Comedy)."
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"You’re not kidding about Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle. I laughed my ass off from beginning to end when I first watched it, and I was SO not a member of the movie’s target audience, being a non-stoner, and in my late forties at the time. It just goes to show that people should take a chance on movies they think they won’t like.The “Christmas” sequel, however, completely sucked."
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"Walk Hard is amazing. The comedy, the freaking music is 100% amazing, and nearly every scene perfectly displays the years through which Dewey's life runs through."
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,nice to see Galaxy Quest appreciation. Truly an underrated gem

healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"""Hachi : a dog's tale"" is almost impossible not to cry"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I know this sounds so stupid but I'm kinda scared to watch that because I have heard it is so sad. I still have never watched Marley and me..even though I love Jennifer Aniston! I just know I'll be bawling 🤦‍♀️
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I started watching this on Amazon Prime and when I came back to finish it they'd made it pay to view. My go to sad dog movie is A Dog's Purpose
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8, @Zoey x  oh that happened to me on a series I was watching! So annoying!
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I cried so hard watching this movie. It broke my heart.
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"My favorite sad dog movie is ""The Art of Racing In the Rain"".  I strongly recommend it."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,YESSSSSSSSS
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I bawled my eyes out to Hachi (it didn’t help that I was 8 months pregnant and highly emotional)
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,So true!
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Baby listen I thought about that dog the next dam day! That movie took me out!
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8, @K.C. Fahel  this is the one!
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Also, I even bawled Coco last scene where Miguel plays and sings for her before saying, ""your papa loved you very much"" 😭😭😭😭😭😭"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Oh that wrecks me!  But at the end,  she is with her mom and dad, and the family keeps going, so it is a nostalgic cry for me."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,yes that was so emotional. mama coco is sooo cute
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,i couldn't stop crying🥺
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I cry every single time. Ugly crying.

healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8, @bard the nascar fanatic dragon  I havent seen Sonic the Hedgehog.
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8," @Rio Toews  you mean shadow the hedgehog? it's a video game from 2005. I said that because of ""Never Turn Back."""
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8, @bard the nascar fanatic dragon  ohhh okay yeah I don't think I have played it lol sorry
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8, @Rio Toews  never turn back is the closing song.
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,“I wish I knew how to quit you” 🥺 That line just hits different
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,jack fucking twist broke my heart
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I agree, Jake and Heath are such fantastic, charismatic actors, and that line hits me right in the feels! 😭"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,what movie you guys are talking about?what is its name?
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8, @BeetleJuice  brokeback mountain
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Brokeback Mountain is such a beautifully written tragic love story... Amazing acting by Jake & Heath, beautifully shot, and masterfully crafted by the amazing Ang Lee."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,❤️❤️❤️
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,It truly does
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"""Crying helps me slow down and obsess over the weight of life's problems."" -Sadness, Inside Out"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"""Titantic"" never fails to make me weep. When Rose utters ""I'll never let go, Jack, that's my cue to bawl uncontrollably! 😭💔"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Agreed. Such a beautiful line from a heartbreaking epic.
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"The she LETS go! As a younger girl watching I was like ""you let him...go"" yt growing up, wiser you get the significance of that line. She will never let him go.....from her heart. 💕💔"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8," @Kerry Ann  Too true, you never really forget your first love. I did feel a little sorry for Rose's deceased husband, though, since she'd presumably lived a long and happy life with him as well."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,she could’ve moved over 🙄✋🏽
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"and the fact that he doesn't necessarily mean never let go of him, but to never let go of her freedom and lust for life"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8, @Nikki B  yeah I got the film ending much clearer as I watched it as I got older. When I was young and seen it I took it a bit too literal! 🤣
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,When I saw it I laughed at that part because she says she never let go and then does. But I cried at the very end when rose dies and goes back to jack in the ship along with all the other people that died.
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8, @celestedits  24 years later and people are still talking about that controversy.
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I felt so bad bc i laughed when i watched it
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"The movie that holds a record for making me cry three times in just 120 minutes is ‘Train to Busan’. This may sound weird but this one was literally a masterpiece. After knowing the genre, I never thought it could be this much amazing because I was tired of watching such movies but I fell for this one and I fell hard. Apart from that ,the editing, direction, storyline are all fabulous.I don’t guarantee that while watching this you will cry but I’m sure you won’t regret watching this."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,yooo thank GOD someone wrote this. That movie kills me
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,That ending had me bawling like a baby
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I cant believe the notebook isnt even an honourable mention. That film gets me every time😭😭
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I am always a blubbering mess after watching The Notebook. Even though I know whats going to happen.  Apart from A Bridge to Terabithia the others on the list just seemed a bit meh
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I haven't watched the entire video yet, I guessed it would be right at the top. There's plenty of movies I wished were on the list.The Other Side of the MountainBrian's SongSomething for JoeyThe ChampI could go on and on."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,The Boy in the Striped Pajamas. I can never forget sobbing my eyes out to that movie.
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I just commented on that one after not seeing it, and here it is. It made me completely sad and feeling a bit uneasy about our species."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I just recorded that movie because I haven't seen it in years. I just have to prepare myself first. It's playing on HBO and just found out it's on Hulu too, incase you want to see it again."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Movie name
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"This is underrated, but I cried to ""The Theory of Everything."""
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,For me it will always be 'Marley and me'.I've just lost a dog which was with us for 9 years :( The sadness is beyond.
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I feel thatI cried for our dog when it died
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I feel ""Life is beautiful"" deserves much higher position on this list. That movie is devestating!! I watched it as a teenager and it took me several days to recover emotionally 😳🙄"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Good collection of films. I'd even add The Notebook, Love Story, P.S. I Love You,  Boys Don't Cry and Blue Valentine. I also loved Gone With The Wind...it bring tears to the eye at the doomed love story of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Blue valentine was hard to watch just seen now their life fell apart man that got me
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,My best friend and I went to see Me Before You at the brand new Movie Tavern when it first came out. We left the movie theater SOBBING and the poor waiter asked us if we were ok. We both gave a blubbering “Noooo” as we quickly left the theater 😂😂😂😂😂😂
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"When I went to see it, I could hear all the other people crying along with me."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Five Feet Apart should be in the honorable mentions at least, it simply destroyed me"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Meh
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Yesss
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"See buddy, when i watched that movie, a cried and boy i cried my shit out"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I'm such a emotional wreck when it comes to The Green Mile, My Girl and anything with dying dogs! 🤦‍♀️ cry like baby!"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I’m in tears the last 15-20 minutes of Titanic every time, but when Rose says “I’ll never let go, I promise” I’m sobbing uncontrollably."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Saving Private Ryan to me has plenty of emotional moments from the start to end that blends a perfect balance of sad and respect.  With the song Hymn to the Fallen playing adds that mood. James ""Tell her that when you found me that I was here and I was with the only brothers I had left. There is no reason I would abandon them."" When an old James Ryan speaks to Captain Miller and asks his wife ""Tell me that I led a  good life. Tell me that I am a good man!"""
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"A lot of Nicolas Sparks’ movies made me cry, not only “Walk to remember”, but also “The Last Song” or “The Best of Me”. I believe, that Coco should be mentioned, by the end I was crying a lot..."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"What Dreams May Come, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, too"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I always bawl like a baby whenever I watch Hachi and Marley & me. I even  teared up  watching the clips just now.
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I teared up just watching the scenes for A Walk to Remember, Bride to Terabithia and Marley and Me so I'd definitely say that they're tear jerkers!"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"""Marley & Me"" and ""Toy Story 3"" both made my mom cry. ""Titanic"" is of my all-time favorites. Also, the ending of ""Driving Miss Daisy"" made me cry so much."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I was so glad to see #1 on this list. Not enough people are aware of it and it's such a well made great sweet movie.
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Is it just me or I don’t cry watching titanic 😂😂
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I cried like a baby when Gus told Hazel Grace that his cancer is back he went for a check up and his body lit up like a Christmas tree. I honestly didn't see it coming. I tear up thinking about it now even.
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"""A Walk To Remember"" is brutal, like genuinely brutal. It lures you in with youthful love and a story that twists and turns for good and bad, and ends with both in a joyful devestation."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I've waited two weeks for this list just so I know Hatchi can get the recognition it deserves.
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"That's what i love about these movies, they have such emotional scenes and music in them that not even i can resist shedding a tear!"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Watching ""Marley & me"" i thought i would laugh , but ended up making me cry a lot"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I think that ""The boy in the striped pajamas"" deserves a place  on the list. Its a heart breaking story set in world war two that follows a little boy who finds out about a concentration camp close to his home that his father runs. There's a lot more to the story but it's really good"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Life is beautiful is 1 of my favorite movies. I know it sad from the beginning but the way the characters drive the story makes everything more hopeful wanting 2 believe things will get better. The humor is great but loving but gave me a punch of what happens but a good ending 4 his son.

healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"If I could add one movie to this list, even as an honorable mention, it has to be ""Love And Other Drugs."" It hits me in ways similar to ""A Walk To Remember."""
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Toy Story 3 is the most saddest movie ever of Pixar when we can see Andy saying Goodbye his toys and Woody he say Goodbye Cowboy give us the saddest and prettiest moment ever ever in the animation movie
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"My top tear jerkers are A Walk to Remember, Third Star and Instructions Not included and Bajo La Misma Luna.Third Star stars Benedict Cumberbatch as a terminally ill 20 something taking a trip with his childhood friends.  It was one of the first works I saw with Cumberbatch before the Sherlock madness and it made me fall in love with his performances.  Instructions Not Included is more of a dramedy with one  of my favorite comedians that still manages to make me cry at the end  and release  all my pent up emotion.Only watch Bajo La Misma  Luna if you wanna get your heart ripped to shreds."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"A walk to remember my ultimate favourite movie of all time, I watched it more than 10 times and I'm still crying on it over and over, I just can't 😭😭😭"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Titanic is a masterpiece of James Cameron the story is very interesting and cool,the characters are cool and curious and Jack and Rose they are the cutest and coolest couple in all the time in the movie of Titanic"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Toy Story 3 and E.T. are the kind of movies that makes me happy cry about childhood. Forrest Gump, Shawshank and The Color Purple make me happy cry because they show you that you can overcome anything; teasing, neglect and abuse."

scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,The list of 2021 horror movies list now includes almost 25 films. Check it out. https://pickbe.net/best-horror-movies-2021/
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,"Malignant was a roller coaster!  The nighthouse is probably the best pure horror film with an original concept though. It wraps things up nicely at the end.  Overall  Quiet place ii is the right choice, worthy sequel."
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Malignant was shit
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Quite place 2 is shit. No progress at story level. This part must be full of action as they hv found the solution to kill monsters
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,The night house became my favorite horror movie
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Why are there no good horrors anymore it’s honestly a jok! I can’t be bothered to keep looking for horrors that end up awful every time.
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Everything is just so recycled. I’m tired of the rebooting old movies and copying the same plots from others over and over.
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Watch asian horror
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4, @Lincoln rodgers  give some names pls
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4, @Mishaal Zk  try indonesia film sabrina
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4, @Lincoln rodgers  most Asian horror movies are shit as well
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4, @CaRnAgE_4_Justin  lmao.. then watch comedy.
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4, @Lincoln rodgers  I’ll watch what I want bud
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,The last decent horror movie I watched was 'hereditary'
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4, @The Meat Spot  thats a verygood horror movie..  king paimon
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,"They have to be old, that's what makes them REALLY horrific"
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,1. Halloween kills 2. Come true3. Candy man4. Ware wolves within5. Blood red sky6. Malignant  7. Antlers8. The night house9. The conjuring 10. A quiet place part 2
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Thank you :)
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,And Peppa pig
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,List of garbage. Got it
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Only 9 and 10 are good
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4, @versatile duplicity  those are the worst
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4, @ASTONER  facts
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4, @ASTONER  its all opinions
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4, @OneShortGamer  wrong opinions
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4, @versatile duplicity  the garbage and the quiet turd 2 yikes
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,I've seen all of these. The #1 is Werewolves Within.  I highly recommend it.  It has a very nice twist in it.
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4, @Thompson Evergreen  thats right
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,I don't like werewolves movie bc it's more like an action movie instead of a horror genre
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4," @Umeyama  yeah but it's more about the fact that most monsters in movies are mutated and morphed humans, that's usually why they're scary, we can sense that they're just ""wrong"" so when you see such an active transformation as a human turning into the monster its like we're seeing the birth of one, and also because they're really awesome, not always about the fear - dog soldiers in my opinion was really scary"
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4, @Dylan Killinger  Is it bad haha?
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Hahaha i dont like
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Yaa it has twist but nothing mind blowing..just meh..ok i got it shes the werewolf..then what? So what?  Only good is the comedy part n those crack ppl..the plot simply meh
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,"I wanted to see the conjuring the devil made me do it in cinemas, but I couldn't. Saw it yesterday though it didn't let me down. I love all the conjuring movies"
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Great list but wouldn't we technically consider Malignant a Slasher technically bc murders are happening?
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,You can say that. Slasher films are a genre of horror films.
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4, @5% Entertainment  no
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4, @Iamtommietom  they definitely are lol
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,I've been binging on 2021 horror movie reviews (trying to figure out what to watch) and this is the best one so far. Thanks.
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Same here i can't stop lol
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,It’s like the craze of horror movies is fading dramatically. People are ridiculously liking other genre except HORROR. Moreover the horror movies from past 1-2 years are not that exciting and HORROR-TO-SAY. Miss those times when movies like insidious conjuring Annabelle were made😔😞.
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,"Contrary to criticism, I love Demonic."
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,"For me best horror movies were Autopsy of jane doe,the rite and conjuring.I have never seen someone mention first two movies."
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,"Is the rite where that police woman is looking after that abandoned precinct? And the Jane doe, is that with the father and son team? If so then you my friend really know their horror films 👏"
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4, @Maxwell Sainte   The rite is the one where a seminary student goes to rome to become a exorcist.
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4, @Maryam Iman  yeah I was thinking of the last shift which I recommend if you havnt seen it. Also Host but only with lights off and volume up
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4, @Maxwell Sainte  Great recommendation I really enjoyed The Last Shift! Have you seen The Void?
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4, @Wen Dee  Can't say I have but I'll deffo give it a looksie. Thanks
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4, @Maxwell Sainte  I will definitely see it thank u for recommendation but i would recommend you to watch sleepy hollow and marrowbone.Marrowbone is not horror but psychological but you should definitely watch it.
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4, @Maryam Iman  Sleepy hollow is one of my all time favourite movies! The foreboding music with the misty atmosphere is just perfect. I will give the other one a try thank you
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4, @Maryam Iman  hi maryam
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,MAN the Autopsy of Jane Doe is my favourite movie ever!!!
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4, @Andra Mitru  Yeah it's also my favorite and i love it's unique concept.
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,A quiet place is more of a sci-fi movie to me then horror. Lol... Good movie tho . Ouija origin of evil  is probably the best horror we've gotten since the conjuring  Then you've got the exorcism of Emily rose. The ring . The grudge . Sinister . And I guess insidious... I personally don't think insidious is scary tho... And then if it's a slasher type the strangers. Please someone give me some good scary movies. Lol....
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,"You needed to give a shout-out to one of the best actors ever, Cillian Murphy.  That guy is amazing.  If you haven't you need to watch Peacock, Breakfast on Pluto, (not a horror, but awesome)  Sunshine, 28 Days Later (one of THE best!) and so many more.  If you see his name on it, watch it."
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,I think my favorites were St. Maude and Censor.
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,o
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Thanks so much for this!
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Im having an exam tomorrow and here I am looking for a movie to watch T__T
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Hope it goes well
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,What a great dedication towards study 👍
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Suggest me some horror movie
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Same
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Im here taking a study break haha. exam in 2 days.
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Keep it up! Well done
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Happens to the best of us
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Hope it went well
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,"A classic horror story, was also good."
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,First horror movie list that is actually really good! Can you do a part 2?
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,i dont think he can summon other good horror movies... y'know?
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Good? He literally only named movies that hit theaters lol
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4, @Jordon D'agostino  still good
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4," @Jordon D'agostino  ""Best horror movies of 2021"" i cant think of any others worth mentioning. ive watched a lot. just so happens the good ones came out in theaters."
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,This list doesn't have The Medium.. It's a collab movie from The Shutter director and The Wailing director.
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Malignant and Blood Red Sky both should've been Higher than Antlers But i can understand it's your list. Antlers was disappointing for me even after those long delays and got a very boring horror movie. It could've been better.
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Antlers was good tbh sounded off because of the title but was worth it after I watched it
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,almost exited after halloween kills was on the list...at least it was #10 😅
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Nice list 💯👌
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,"I've never found Halloween movies scary at all, kurguer Jason etc, never found them scary, prefer possession movies."
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Candyman and blood red sky are my fav
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,I loved A Quiet Place II. It flowed right along after the ending of the first movie. Very cool! <3
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,"It's not your fault that the horror movies in 2021 largely sucked, but the fact that you try to make them sound good is really off-putting. You owe your fanbase honest commentary, not fake admiration for the trash these movie studios put out."
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Horror movies aren’t really scary anymore. I liked “his house” tho
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Psycho Goreman is the best horror film of the year IMHO
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Flatliners is an interesting horror/thriller movie from 2017 if i remember correctly.
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,The Conjuring was the #1 best horror movie this year!
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,Blood Red Sky was an AMAZING movie!  One of my favorites.
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,You can't be mentally sound and intentionally put that Halloween movie on a Best horror movie list at the same time.
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,"I don't understand how ppl say movies like ( it ) and Freddy are horror movies,  it's not  even close  , sinister, blair witch , grave encounters, rec , now these are horror movies ."
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,2018 Halloween rocked but the 2021 version SUCKED
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,"And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: (Hebrews 9:27)For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? (Matthew 16:26)For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23)The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. (2 Peter 3:9)"
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,"Halloween kills, Candyman, Antlers  and Conjuring 3 were the worst horror movies 2021.  I think Last Night in Soho and The Deep House, Malignant and A Quiet Place 2 were the best"
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,"please put the names of the movies in the description with links when you are talking about themI understand you might think this will make people watch less of the video, but it actually will make people watch atleast parts of the video."
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,All of these films are underwhelming. Bringback 70's horror.
scary movies recommend,gAMR_eabXN4,"Antlers was bad , they just used the “common horror movie template” and filled in the blanks , could’ve been so much scarier"
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,"For more horror, check out our playlist!: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EmCY657OAI&list=PLmZTDWJGfRq2_fzw_GiOxI2UyyurdIHB0Have you seen any of these films? Let us know in the comments!"

scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,What about the Unholy ?
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,"I know it isn’t exclusively horror, but A Quiet Place II needs that top spot, what an intense, masterfully shot thrill ride."
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,It’s definitely horror. Just think of the overall plot of it. That’s 100% horror.
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A, @Daniel Holguin  tingz is the first time the u.s. military is that a pic so I don't know.(Dont read my name)
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A, @Daniel Holguin  I hate it when people say this movie is more of a thriller like this is horror and it’s great and there is no way that this should not be number one
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,Pretty sure it’s a horror movie
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,"I don't think it deserves top spot because its already in a good place, but thats my opinion"
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,"Quiet Place is highly over rated. The concept has a lot of promise, but hasn't been written with the depth that it needs. It's too loose and predictable, with repetitive tactics used to deal with the creatures. The backstory of these creatures has also not been told with any degree of detail. The second part is much weaker than the first, and it  makes the first part seem better than it really is. An average fare."
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A," @Arjun Ambarnath  1) It's too loose and predictable? Did you honestly knew, for example, that the small kid would die AND would die that soon? Did you knew the father would commit a sacrifice and die? Why it's loose? A bunch of crazy and nonsensical things keep happening? Scenes don't properly follow the previous one? The script is not cohesive?2) Repetitive tactics? The aliens are basically super strong and fast tanks that basically killed almost all humans very easily and the few survivors simply cannot make any sounds louder than a very low whisper, what exactly where you expecting for non-repetitive tactics? Magic? Praying? The power of love? LMAO!3) Not every single movie must explain every single thing and, in the case of this movie, not explaining the aliens' backstory was just a detail that didn't hurt the film at all!"
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,Is the sequel even out yet?
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,100% am waiting for part 3

scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,Horror gang
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,In the dark cold room alone with my thoughts. I love it. My idea of serenity
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,I prefer watching them alone lol
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,From 12 am is my best time watching all alone and everywhere being quiet..
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,I find horror movies relaxing n soothing.
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A, @dodgers doon1130  same but with my wife next to me sleeping she hates scary movies
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,its 1.30 am here and i live alone
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,i wish there was a horror movie i could watch alone. everything i find is too obvious or not horror
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,I don't mind watching horror movies alone
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,"The Stylist also started as a short film which was featured on Alter so despite it not really being my cup of tea, I'm glad it was picked up for a feature length film. The staff must've been proud."
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,Psycho Goreman was one of my favorite indie movies this past yearIt definitely has tons of 80s vibe to it
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,"If you're looking for something special-  ""The Empty Man""  was a mind bending! I highly recommend it."
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,"Most of these movies were from 2019 or 2020, not 2021. I'd like to add ""Werewolves Within"", ""False Positive"" (two of my favorites of the year) and add as honorable mentions: ""Willy's Wonderland"", ""In The Earth"",  and if 2020 films still apply then I'm definitely shouting out ""Possessor: Uncut"", ""i'm thinking of ending things"", ""Freaky"", ""Swallow"", and there's a ton I still have yet to see for this year that need to come out like ""The Green Knight"", ""Last Night In Soho"", ""Old"", ""The Night House"", etc."
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,"Watch ""Gaia"". It´s pretty good."
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,Loved Willy's Wonderland and Freaky.
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,The Vigil had a great plot and an eerie tone BUT the ending of the movie resolved waaaaaay too quick and way too easy.
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,"some of these films had premieres at TIFF or elsewhere in 2019-2020, but did not release in the US until 2021. that’s probably why the list includes them (for anyone wondering)"
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,High fashion and horror go hand in hand. Sometimes you see a masterpiece that’s not a complete turd.
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,I seen a few 2019 but I would of added “The Empty Man” an amazing future cult following classic for sure. PG was a hidden gem for sure and loved it!
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,"The Empty Man was great, it was much better than the trailer made it look."
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,I've already seen the devil made me do it Conjuring 3 and just this morning I watch a quiet place part II both are remarkable in their own unique way
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,"Judging by this list, it has been a shit year so far for horror movies"
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,I actually haven’t seen most of these! What an awesome Halloween horror treat I have to look forward to now! 
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,"Wow, just watched Violation on these recommendations.  Fantastic, unique movie.  But ambiguous, no catharsis, and bleak, above all else, utterly bleak-- all characteristics that are going to make it unpopular with most viewers.  But I loved it, so thanks for recommending it!"
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,Watched saint maud last month it was awesome. I think its also one of the best movies of 2021. Also watched Conjuring 3. It was decent too.
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,I was surprised at how entertaining Psycho Goreman was. A fantastic film!

scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,You are a good human. :) Thank you
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,Goreman isnt even scary it’s literally just hella gore and its mostly comedy
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,"""False Positive (2021)"" is awesome too, it will definately be on the list for the Top 10 Best Horror Movies from 2021. It's on hulu."
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,"Could you please make a list pf1. Top 20 critically acclaimed films that audience hated (e.g. Star Wars 9)2. Top 20 critically destroyed films that audience loves.But it be movies that found audience love immediately, not over time (not a cult film of gone years like Tron 1982)"
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,"There has to be someone out there that will make a really good horror movie based on sleep paralysis. As someone who suffers from this regularly, there is SO MUCH that could be done in the horror movie genre using old beliefs on why it happens (before modern doctors figured out why)."
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,"Hey guys great job, I come to this channel whenever I need some recommendation on movies to watch, just done watching Saint Maud...and I am like totally disappointed that this is termed a horror movie in the first place. But thanks anyway"
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,Psycho Goreman looks cool and worth a watch.  Makes me think of “The Wishmaster”.
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,I'm so glad Psycho Goreman made the list! Its my favorite movie of this year!
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,"I'm happy for Saint Maud, it's the best horror so far this year, but Censor is not in the list? It should be in the top 3."
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,"Did yall watch the new series called From? its actually REALLY good in my opinion, its a horror regarding a cursed town that u cant escape with monsters that hunt u down when the sun goes down :-D BRILLIANT writing as well, defs recommend to any horror fan"
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,The forever purge was really good  I enjoyed it very much
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,"Im a little shocked Saint Maud got the #1 spot. Not to say its a bad movie, far from it, but I feel like its subject matter would upset some people."
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,"the conjuring 3 was so awful, i experienced zero fear. zilch!"
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,psycho goreman is a delightful tribute to 80's horror movie fans..
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,"Great video ,massive horror fan . Some of these need to watch some of these . Love Spiral from the book of saw and A quiet place part 2"
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,Guys the films here listed were released internationally in 2019 but then COVID hit us in 2020 so their US release wasn’t until 2021. That’s why Saint Maud and Queen Of Black Magic is here.
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,"""Do you like being afraid""  right off the bat he is the killer. That line was super suspect."
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,The Queen of Black Magic give me a nightmare about trypophobia sceneBut it released on 2019 in IndonesiaCheck out another Indonesian Horror Movie and they will blow your mind
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,I thought a lot of people said that spiral(haven't seen it)was horrible and conjuring 3(it was okay) was horrible. PG and the Indonesian horror movie was interesting. Saint Maud ending was disturbing . A lot of the other movies are on my list.
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,"St. Maud is so good, the power too, thank you for the list"
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,watchmojo should mention that the Queen of Black Magic is a remake / reboot from the classic horror played by horror legend Suzzanna :)
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,KIRSTEN NEEDS TO BE IN MORE VIDEOS!
scary movies recommend,coIHeihoQ-A,Whoaa! Queen of Black Magic! 
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,"Looking forward to see Negan in ""The unholy"". Color out of space with Nicolas Cage was pretty good, Willy's wonderland was just strangely weird."
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,"On point! Cage was eerily weird but it was kinda funny and entertaining, but that Unholy was really good, everyone calls him Neegan, but that's John Henry Winchester right there!! 😂"
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,"Somebody said ""Malignant"" should've been on there which definitely was a great horror flick, uniquely different than the usual."
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,exactly
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,My god i was hoping to read such comment. Malignant is my top 3 horrors played in 2021
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,"An unfortunate absence from this list is Last Night in Soho, more psychological thriller horror, but easily the best of 2021."
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,It was good ❤️
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,"God i loved it, it was beautifully made."
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,The Wretched was one of the best horror films I've ever seen. Not on the list but check it out.
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,I agree!!
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,You’re having a laugh right? It was ok. I’ll give it a 6/10
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,"You r a woman ,right ?"
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,"Candyman, the unholy, spiral ( maybe cause I’m a big fan of saw haha) all sucked to me, and I was a little disappointed with the conjuring( and love those movies). Definitely want to check out Antlers when it comes out."
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Antlers sucked btw..candyman was the worst..spiral sucked so bad I can't even remember it.lol
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,"All about as scary as watching Elmo in a bad mood. Antlers almost hit the mark, great atmosphere, had the potential to be really good but needed more monster character development. The underlying story of the school teacher was pointless."
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Antlers and Candyman are the only ones I'm looking forward to
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,"the antlers is the movie that ive been waiting for,. like forever.."
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Me too....seems interesting
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Hell yeah.....
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,"They just keep delaying the goddam movie, if they keep doing it, it might just never be released and will vanish in a pile of dust."
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,its probably never gonna release.. been more than a year of waiting.. lol
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Finally released guys
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Muito ansioso pra assistir
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,എന്തുട്ടാ..??
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,"Don't breathe two and a quiet place part two, Halloween kills, Spiral from the book of saw & Candyman! Can't wait until they're released."
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Spiral is the best!
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE, @Dian Nazareno  true.
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Candyman 🍭 was actually really REALLY REALLY GOOD.  In story and acting.  Halloween 🎃 and Antlers 🦌  should be in the top three
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,"Naaaah! It was actually really REALLY REALLY BAD. In story and acting. And now, popular opinion. The circle is now complete. Way to go, Zero! 🤣"
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE, @Dion St. Michael  that’s why it was number 1 for a minute. Not popular opinion your opinion ok girl bye girl fly girl 👧 foh
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Wow! You must not be a horror fan
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE, @Dion St. Michael  Yep. It's really bad. Halloween and Antlers too. Don't Breathe 2 is also way inferior than the 1st one Don't Breathe.
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,"I'm only waiting for :the conjuring, don't breathe & a quiet place ❤️"
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Me too conjuring and insidious 5
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE, @n  yes Insidious 5 as well. I forgot about it!
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,SAME HERE!!! 🤗
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,"Well, just finished watching a quiet place 2 and i was so disappointed! Hope the other movies are better 👌"
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Well Conjuring was not scary at all.
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Of  course you are. You are the reason that Hollywood releases crap sequels and remakes.
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE," @Iภvaͥᖙeͣrͫz⇜   conjuring 1 is very scary,u talk shit bout it when quiet place nor insidious was scary"
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,"Really?! Cuz, pretty sure nobody cares! Literally! 🤣"
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Dion St. Michael If you're socially awkward then just don't comment.
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE," @Incontinentia Buttocks  Bite me, Zero!"
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,"This list does make sense, how can they be on the list if they haven't been seen yet, how can they have a rating?"
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Time travel
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,"Cuz, CNext says so D-minus! Cuz, CNext sed so!"
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE, @Guarding Soul  hahah😁😁
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Which country are u in?
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,The empty man was one of the best this year.
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,"Meh, it was decent to me, I liked the vibe tho, you got any other picks dude, lookn for some good ones"
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,💯
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,"I'm just waiting for Malignant, coz when it comes to horror ain't nobody mess with James Wan"
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,James Wan is the Man when it comes to scary movies. I wish he would do something with the Crooked Man can't see anyone else doing it RIGHT!
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Me too..
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Malignant is another level of horror🔥🔥🔥
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Malignant is a super horror movie.. I watched it..
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,I thought it was a comedy. The most ridiculous movie I've ever seen
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Can't wait to see antlers been waiting since last year 🤘
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Me to
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Did you watch it? Is it good?! I want to watch it I think.
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,"Fascinating...cept, nobody cares how long you wait. Literally, nobody. Not even 👆🏻 guy!"
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE, @Dion St. Michael  smh
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE, @kocain Kitty  smd
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE, @Dion St. Michael  smd

scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Truly thanks to whoever who made this video. This is the channel I been looking for.
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Thank you
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,"I love horror movies, I just can't watch gore ones like Saw, Wrong Turn, Final Destination, and Halloween"
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Horrors ain’t horrors without gore I need that goosebump feeing ya kno
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Same here

Send a direct message to my private chat I got something for you. Stay safe 🌹❤️
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,I just finished watching The Conjuring.  It was good.
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,"No it's not that's much good. There is less scary scenes. But the storyline waz good which depicts the strength of love. But overall I dunno y I don't like it, there is nothing to get scared!!😤"
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE, @Suhaila SulZzz  well it wasn’t great but it was ok.  It wasn’t as scary as I had hoped.
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE, @lorigee1  yeahh didn't reach up to the expectation level of audience. Very disappointing
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,James Wan didn't direct this one. It was good just not scary.
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE," @Suhaila SulZzz  conjuring is the most horrific movie if you ask me, and I've watched every horror movie but conjuring is at different level if you watch a good volume. If you think any other movie is more good please mention the name"
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE," @Elderny  possession of Hanna graceAutopsy of Jane doeExorcism of Emily RosePet semeteryBut all these can't beat our old film ""Evil dead"" it's freaking scary ."
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE, @Suhaila SulZzz  watched all of time still Conjuring is the best 😎
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE, @Elderny  Conjuring was definitely not scarier than Insidious. No way in hell. Sinister was also scarier imo.
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE, @Robert Wallace  look i watched all of them but the difference between conjuring was that i watched it at night with my relatives in blacked out room with big speakers😅
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE, @Elderny  oh yeah the black out room is a must. That's how I watch them all. Guarantee if you watched Insidious like that you would agree. Scariest movie I ever saw.
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,I saw conjuring 2.That was a great movie 🥰🥰🥰😍😍
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,"I am looking forward to Candyman, and Antlers.  I saw the conjuring 3,and Spiral. They were ok."
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,I’ve been waiting for Antlers for over a year!
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Unholy... And halloween kills 😍
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,Candyman and antlers look amazing!!
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,I watched every one of these except for don't breath 2 and I can say every one of them sucked ass.Can't wait to watch disappointment Blvd.
scary movies recommend,DmXQr_jNlQE,I'm waiting for Halloween Kills since last year. Hopefully it's gonna be good.

scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,It's impossible to watch paranormal activity alone anyways. You need someone to wake you up halfway through.
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,I know ya? I'm glad my dog was with me when I was. I was this close to missing the small amounts of interesting parts in the movie.
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"Agreed,watched it alone and fell asleep"
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,True. Just the last 5 mins are good.
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Nicee
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,So true
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Me and my cousin were watching that shitty movie and had to skip to the end cause it was boring us to sleep!
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,I had to put my legs in a bucket of ice to watch it alone
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"To be fair, Paranormal Activity is a better horror movie than Bats. Bats was so terrible my friend and I were laughing at it when we were 11."
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,True
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Ryan Boomhower ha
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Any other horror fans searching for something new and getting disappointed when you realise you've watched everything
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,I know that feeling.
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Either I’ve seen them or I’m not allowed to watch them(I’m 13)
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Hello brother
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Yes
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Also love ur pfp
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,I don't really watch all these maybe someday later?..
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Martyrs best one i've found the older one not that remake crap.
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,honestly tho the movies mentioned in this video r not like scary at all I was literally disappointed when I saw this lmfao
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,What's your best suggestion Maxmillion?
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0," @v h  Im afraid theres no short answer to that. So many sub genres and everyone has a different taste and motivation for watching horror. Personally i don't watch for a scare thrill as i've always been able to disconnect myself from the screen, i watch for a love of monsters and the macabre and for a general love of cinema (my other favourite genre being SciFi). Some of my modern favourites; A quiet place, Hereditary (i'm with the half who actually liked it :P), The Babadook, Get Out, The Ritual; Favourite creature horror, Carpenters The Thing and the Alien series;  Classics like The Shining, The Omen, The Birds; The Evil dead series(older ones); Not to mention foreign cinema especially korean or japanese horror, fave recently being Train to Busan(excellent zombie movie). Stuff on my list to watch Kill List by Ben Wheatly and Midsommar by Ari Aster. Sorry for the wall of text, like i said no short answer and i could keep going as this is just a drop in the ocean of things i've enjoyed. My best advice would be to narrow down what type of thing you're looking for and just go through some ""best of"" lists for stuff that peaks your interest."
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"Here's the list if anyone doesn't have time to watch the video:20 - The Shining(0:37)19 - Green Room(1:16)18 - Raw(1:59)17 - It follows(2:49)16 - A Nightmare on Elm Street(3:34)15 - It(4:19)14 - The Babadook(5:08)13 - The Strangers(6:07)12 - V/H/S/2(6:47)11 - Drag Me to Hell(7:34)10 - Funny Games(8:13)9 - Paranormal Activity(8:55)8 - REC(9:26)7 - The Conjuring(9:58)6 - The Grudge(10:38l5 - The Ring(11:19)4 - The Witch(12:10)3 - Hereditary(13:03)2 - The Blair Witch Project(13:51)1 - The Exorcist(16:03) Honorable Mentions:The Sixth Sense(14:28)Alien(14:46)Veronica(15:04)The Green Inferno(15:23)Terrifier(15:38) You're welcome!"

scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,what the hell i saw a nightmare on elm street when i was 6
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,you stile this comment someone did this a year ago and your wrting is exaclty like his not cool man
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0, @ava   look
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0, @Dr Raunak Singh  look
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"Nice,you effort eh?Thank you!♥️"
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"all you did was copy and paste another person's comment, so no thank you"
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,I watched 'Nightmare On Elm Street' on my own and I fell asleep straight away Also 'IT' isn't that scary. More funny than scary
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,I agree i laughed well watching it is more funny unless your scared of clowns It gets to much credit
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,I like IT's cgi
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Facts
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"I’m scared of clowns, but this pennywise was more like a monster than a normal clown. So I found it laughable as well"
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,I can watch a nightmare on elm street on my own not that scary
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Everyone's saying the IT remake is better than the original bcs CGI was not as good in the olden days neither were the special effects
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,True
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Same experience here
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"Well you should have read the book. Most of Kings books are pure mindfuck because he's playing with the center of your personal fears. Per Cemetery... wow I couldn't sleep because hearing this little feet rumbling on wooden  floor. ( I don't even have a wooden floor.😂) Don't watch that King adaptions , except shining they're nothing compared to his books."
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,IT is actually very funny
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,“You truly have to be sick and twisted to try and watch this movie by yourself”Me: stoooooop you’ll make me blush
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,🚫🧢
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Me: “You say that like it’s a bad thing.”
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Did you watch Martyrs or Antichrist? Just as a tip. They're mind-blowing.
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"Sick is my first name, twisted is my last name, watching movies like this is what I live for"
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Why thank you!
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0, @Lady Tempress  these two r nothing compared to serbian movie.
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0," @sreetama datta  well for a reason I think. There don't have to be tons of these sick movies for pleasing persons you don't even want to know. Too me it's pretty awful and cynical to produce such a movie while thousands of children live this nightmare every day for real.  This Regisseur needs a therapist. He just was trying to sell this disgusting movie like it's kind of art. It isn't at all! It's okay to provoke, almost every Genre did. But a Serbian film is nothing but a disgusting piece of shit and I wish they were never allowed to show or sell it."
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0," @Lady Tempress  i understand that. but this was a conversation on ""sick and twisted movies"" and honestly i don't think I've watched anything sicker."
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0, @sreetama datta  well in that point you're definitely right.
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,I am proud to say that I am sick and twisted
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"Insidious is the only movie I ever watched where I had a hard time sleeping after. To be fair I was 12, but now I’m a horror fanatic and I’ve watched almost all of these alone and at night."
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,im nine and i watched that it was good.kinda boring
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Yeah insidious was quiet scary but the third part oring
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,like you
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"I remember I first watched Insidious when I was in like 3rd or 4th grade. That shit scared me and I could not sleep that night, lol. Now I'm 18, and I've seen so many horror movies and I don't get scared as easily anymore. But there are occasionally some movies that give me a good scare, like Hereditary, The Conjuring, and The Babadook."
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"I was watching the first one alone at night. My Uncle Sam came in the house, asked me what I was watching, and I about jumped out of the chair. Do NOT watch Insidious alone!"
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,That happen to me with Hush but I was 7
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Insidious was the best one but not the scariest the second one was so scary for me
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Insidious and Conjuring are great franchises
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Insidious is my only favorite horror series because it has an excellent story line
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0," @Navneek Singh  The Conjuring is good too, but way scarier. they have the same creators I think"
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Videos title: 20 movies you shouldn’t watch alone My thought process: 20 things I am going to watch alone
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Me too bro
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Yes
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,True......
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,XD
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,INTROVERTS UNITE ;-)
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Mr Blue i believe it’s actually a reverse psychology approach so that peeps like us will do what they intentionally wanted us to do in the first place.Just my two cents here though... 😆
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,i am thinking the same thing
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,True
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Same
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Exactly. With the lights off at night because I don't want to ruin the experience.
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"Is it just me, or does watching a scary movie alone add to the experience?"
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,I agree
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Agreed!
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Well no watch mojo horror list is complete without The Exorcist.
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Greatest horror movie of all time
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,They should change the title as follows: 20 movies where you won't feel alone anymore after watching
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,😂😂😂

scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,I actually watched The Witch alone 😂 it wasn't too bad actually. I highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't like cheap jumpscares.And one of the best I've seen alone is 100% Hereditary. I've never been able to sleep alone since 🤣

scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Thank you noble man. You have done our world an honorable favor.
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Mr J Thank You!
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,:)
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0, @Mr J  good job man... Appreciate it
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Thanks
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Mr J Thanks man 👍🏻😎
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Too many overrated and unoriginal modern horror movies. Alien is not in the top 20? Suspiria? Black Christmas? Halloween? Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)? The Thing? Event Horizon? Cannibal Holocaust? Carrie? The Texas Chainsaw Massacre? Cabin Fever? High Tension? Inside? The Brood? The Changeling? Tenebre?
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"""The Sixth Sense"" : There is only one scene that I can't watch, and that is the one that introduces the little girl's ghost. But that's because I'm grossed out by the sight of her vomiting."
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"It Follows is one of the must unique, tense, and genuinely creepy movies I've ever seen."
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"I watched Green Room last night and honestly, it was decent, but everything happened exactly the way I would have imagined it to happen. The gore was well proportioned but it was overall predictable. The VHS series is terribly scary I think, as is Hereditary. The Witch was kind of boring, but the ending is great so it redeems some of the boring bits."
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"I definitely agree with ""The Exorcist"" as being No.1 on the list. There is NO WAY I would watch that movie by myself. I tried watching it in the daytime once by myself but that didn't last very long lol"
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,I went to see The Shining on a remastered version on theatres in Halloween Night with a friend. We both had the greatest time of our lives.
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Good to know
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Hereditary is absolutely the only horror movie I’ve watched that lingers in my mind for truly scaring me
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"Agreed!All things considered, it was worse than the Exorcist...😱"
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"I tried to watch hereditary at night with a friend. We couldnt complete the challenge and we turned the lights on. I was at his house and after the movie i had to leave and he was home alone. I ran as fast as i could to the elevator and got home really quick. Good for me i was with my family, my friend was alone the whole night..."
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0, @Sorin Gabriel  lol you lived your friend alone 😆
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0, @V.Vishnu gaming and art  His parents didn't allow me to stay overnight unfortunately
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0, @Sorin Gabriel  sorry I understand
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Who else has watched at least one of these alone
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"I'm surprised John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" didn't end up on this list, if you are watching it for the first time it's a nail biter, it really shows what fear and isolation can do to people, add in a creature that can absorb and imitate any organic life it comes into contact with down to the smell of a human's breath"
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,You must be sick and twisted if you can watch this by yourself.Me: Yes.
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,I watched every single one of these films at night alone. I slept fine.
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"I remember I was 14 when I watched ""The Grudge"" alone, I couldn't sleep for more than a week. It was my first horror movie. Now I'm 17, ""The Grudge"" is my favourite horror movie, and by watching ""Conjuring"", with my brother, I understood that the demonic possession genre was the scariest for me."
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"You have to watch horror movies alone, that’s how you get the full experience, and immersion, of the movie itself."
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,“The autopsy of Jane Doe” needs to be on this list. I made the mistake of watching that alone the other night and could not sleep for hrs 😂
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,I watched 7 among these 20  in the night being alone with headphones
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,Am I the only one who genuinely didnt think that A Nightmare On Elm Street  scary?
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,I watched The Shining by myself in the dark and that movie is just amazing!
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,The best way to experience the real feel of a a horror movie is to watch it alone... ALWAYS WATCH ALONE!❤😈❤
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,The scariest pat of watching the exorcist was finding out it was supposed to be a horror movie.
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,I remember when paranormal activity came out. Everyone said it was the scariest movie at the time but now it’s been parodied so much no one finds it scary anymore
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"Oh I loved the Shining, it wasn't really scary for me but the acting and the story were so good that I could watch it thousand times! And the Book was awesome too!Just like all Stephen King movies and books!😍"
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"Horror isn't a horror if you watch it with someone.I will watch them alone,of course."
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,The shinning is actually one of the calmest films I've seen. The build up is nice. I especially enjoy the bar scenes. I usually fall asleep by the final moments.
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"It follows! What a great movie that was. It created its own rules for everything, the pace, the mood and definitely the background music. That movie made my day."
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"Here's my horror watchlist: • The Conjuring • The Conjuring 2 • Insidious • Paranormal Activity • The Exorcism of Emily Rose • The Exorcist • The VVitch • Amityville • PoltergeistFor those wondering why I did not include it, I haven't seen the third Conjuring film. Although I'm definitely planning on watching it!"
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,i watched insidious by myself and it was scary as hell. hereditary also seems scary as hell.i’ve seen the conjuring hundreds of times and i love it.
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"I’ve watched every single movie on this list aside from two and Goosebumps (like from the 90s) scares me way more than any of these movies ever will 😂. I love horror movies and the only movie that has ever truly creeped me out was Train to Busan. That movie is beyond disturbing and horrifying. I remember when The Conjuring came out and everyone said it was super scary. I thought it was an amazing movie and the acting was suburb, but def not scary. Just my opinion though."
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,You must be sick and twisted to watch a nightmare on elm street alone? You mean the first horror movie I ever saw at the age of 5 which 95% of the time I watch alone?
scary movies recommend,FJgCxoj2-Z0,"I remember staying up late one night to watch The Shining alone in my room. Personally, I really didn’t find it all that scary. The only scene that really stuck with me was the scene with the naked older lady laughing hysterically in room 237. Other than that, the film was just kinda blah 🤷‍♀️"
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,I have never understood the hate for Lost world. It’s a fantastic sequel
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,The acting in Jurassic Park is some of the best acting of all time. And for the 1990’s the effects are amazing. Just imagine what the movie would be with today’s technology
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,"the effects are extremely good yes, everything else is pretty average to be fair"
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,"Jp1 is the best, best acting, realistic, original music"
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,I just hate how the kids always screaming other than that it’s all good
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,I absolutely love the first Jurassic Park and I also enjoy the others so here's my ranking of them5. Jurassic Park lll 5.5/104. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom 7/103. Jurassic World 7.5/102. The Lost World: Jurassic Park 8/101. Jurassic Park 10/10
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,The 1st Jurassic Park is simply unbeatable.  The thrill and  excitement of every scene are simply amazing.
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,"For some reason it’s super complicated  for me to rate JP films, I just love them so much."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,Elemental Jedi Same here.
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,Elemental Jedi I really enjoyed all of them. Some are worst than another but still really good.
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,"Elemental Jedi same, but for me its the other way around, in my opinion theyre all so bad that its hard to rank them, only jw 1 & 2 are good"
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,TFEXY I'm guessing you're young
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,Dashawn Jesus ?
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,Dashawn Jesus wdym
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,Elemental Jedi  Me too!
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,TFEXY 'cause all the young people like JW because some nonsense reasons
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,"Der Finder The JW movies seem to be more focused on ""brutality"" than the original ones. When you watched JP 1-3 at the time they came out or shortly after, then JW 1-2 don't seem to capture the ""theme""() you felt this time . When you watch JP 1-3 in this century the graphics are just not looking this good in comparison to JW1-2 and you just know films being focused on graphics rather than story. I think that's why younger persons prefer JW."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,TFEXY he means because you have a weird refusal to type up full words and that you probably can’t appreciate the originals. Everyone I’ve seen/known have considered the first Jurassic Park as their favorite in the franchise despite their view on the sequels. Many even consider it to be the best movie of all time. It’s almost scientifically impossible to hate Jurassic Park unless you’re a kid who’s never really taken the time to watch the original or just doesn’t think it’s cool because it’s old. Feel bad for people who have that view on the latter for any older movie.
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,The Lost world is very underrated
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,"Tru, it’s just some good fun."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,Agreed
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,Although its blurry but its still good movie :)
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,It's the only sequel I enjoy
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,"nah, it’s not why does everyone like it? it’s so badly written, Vince Vaughn is terrible. do people like it because it’s fun? Movies can be fun and well written at the same time. The Incredibles is an example."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA, @Blu New  I don't think Vince is bad
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA," @Ja'Len Fulp  nah hes terrible actor, he’s awful in everything, especially here and that Psycho remake "
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA, @Blu New  how was he bad in the role
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA," @Ja'Len Fulp  he’s just not a good actor, heard he’s just very rude too yikes."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA, @Blu New  so one actor breaks the film
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,All of the hate for The Lost World doesn’t make sense to me.  Re-watch it.  The movie is good.
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,"Cody R As a kid i actually watched the lost world then 3 then the original in that order lol.  Now as an adult i put the Original, the lost world, and 3 in that order."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,Cody R it’s not hate I enjoy it. The only movie that gets hate is jp3 which jp3 deserves. People just like the other movies better.
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,"Cody R Same With Me, Like Even Tho I Love JP3 I Understand Why People Hate It, But I Can't For The Hell Of My Life, Simply Understand How The Fuck People Hate Lost World"
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,"Cody R It has dumb sequences such as raptor gymnastics but aside from that it's a solud movie with some of the most tense scenes in the franchise,"
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,"Just because it's close to the bottom, doesn't mean they automatically hate it"
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,I hate lost world. The sequences are all trash. Actually enjoyed watching jurassic world and fallen kingdom more than lost world.
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,"True - I didn't like it the first time a watched it at about age 13, but then when I re-watched it recently I realized that it was actually good."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,"Honestly, I watched the lost world two days ago, and I liked it even less than previous times I’ve watched it. I’m not saying I hate it I like all Jurassic films, but I could barely watch the movie at most parts. Towards the end, it just felt like it was going on for about 30 minutes longer than it should’ve, and I did not like the roles of some characters. I will give it to them though, it was nice to see more t rex screen time, especially since there were two. After all though, jp3 is still my favorite though, and I’ve seen it a trillion times ever since I was little."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,The movie is a masterpiece! <3
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,Fallen Kingdom made me appreciate The Lost World more. Funnily enough.
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,I love JP3. I thought that the storyline was a nice change. It was easy to follow for me as a kid and I like how the incident brought the family back togeather
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,i agree top 5 best movies ever
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,Same
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,"I can see the problems in it, but I can still enjoy it"
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,same i dont see the hate i think the dinosaur selection is one of the best part
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,The parents though are bad and isn’t it a bit to short? But in all honestly it doesn’t heavily rely on nostalgia and there is fun to be had.
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA, @rBlake Apostol  yea but one of my fav thing is the new remodleing/colering
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,In my opinion I really loved fallen kingdom. It has some of the best action in the entire series and the story it actually really well set up and the characters grow from the first one
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,"Problem with the Jurassic sequels is all the magic is lost after seeing one of them, the books/original movie was based on the magic of seeing a living dinosaur"
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,"What magic in the book? The book is a Sci-fi horror story with gruesome death and commentary on the state of science at the time. (Late comment, I know)."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,I'd argue that jurrasic world bought back emotions with actors who we know will stay with the story it had great charaters and great plot but I respect youre opinion
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,"The books absolutely didn’t have that magic feeling. It was pure horror at some points, and it is what Fallen Kingdom tries and succeeds to recreate"
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,"That was literally the point of Jurassic world and the sequels never tried to use ""magic"""
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,I feel like the lost world was really underrated.
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,it is
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,Agreed
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,"I recently watched it it’s a good film, rather boring sometimes."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA, @Liam  yes3 is also undereated
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,I always loved the infamous San Diego ending and I feel like I’m the only one lol 
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,"There’s like 100 comments here saying it’s underrated, makes me think it’s not really underrated then. Lol, no hate obviously."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,My top:1) Jurassic park2) Jurassic World3) i actually like jurassic park 3
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,Carolina Rivera I agree with you
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,I also like jp 3
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,Greg B I love the Lost World.But I do agree with you that JP3 gets to much hate
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,"I don’t like Jurassic Park 3, but Jurassic Park 2 is worse."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA, @A M  Jurassic park 2 is my least favourite of all the movies . 3 was better
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,Carolina Rivera what about fallen kingdom
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,Sample Text FK is my second favourite in the franchise
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,Spider-Man Forever! Yeah jp is my favourite and fk is my second
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,"Yeah, I agree with the Jurassic Park III ranking, but not with the Jurassic World ranking. I think is overvalued."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,JP 3 BEST
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,"All movies were not bad, even JP 3 but, some movies are just more special"
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,Magic Johnson i love you!!!I think the same thing!!
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,Gabriel the tiranosaur yup
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,exactly what I said
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,i love all the Jurassic movies
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,Really only the first Jurassic Park felt special. I really feel it should have never got sequels.
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,Your right
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,I feel the same way...3 was the first one I saw
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,This is what I love bout this franchise it doesn’t disappoint immensely ever
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA, @Paul  why
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,"I grew up watching these movies they're one of my favorite movie franchise I watched 1, 2 and 3 more then 25 times easy. I've watched world about 5 times and fallen kingdom twice and honestly I can't rate one higher/lower then the others. They're all 5/5 if you ask me."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,Ludvig Heir yes they are 5/5 for me......
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,I can respect that. I like all the movies but not all the same
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,i’ve watched world legit like 50 times
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,1asPLoYQCQA,"I might be the worst critic for these movies since I'm just excited to see dinosaurs on screen. Easily watched The Land Before Time over a milion times and when The Flintstones AND Jurassic Park were in cineparcs, I went nuts. For the first time I could see 'real' dinosaurs. So I kinda like them all, can binge-watch the whole saga no sweat. But I do have some preferences and here goes:3. Jurassic Park III (cant unsee the Spino rolling a big fat blunt when the plane crashes in the forest.. Good to see some Pteras get some screen time. Raptor co-op looked good but I cant discard the fact that real raptors would've probably shred Grant & cie before leaving with the eggs..)2. The Lost World: Jurassic Park (The cracking glass scene was jaw dropping, followed by 2 Rex sharing dinner! Raptors went in full pack ambush, Stego and Pachys getting even a bit of action, rampaging Triceratops, perfection!)2. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (from the trailers I was hoping to see a Grady/Blue co-op with the ""are you thinking what I'm thinking?"" scene, turns out it was still real awesome. Indoraptor looks menacing, better than Indominous.. finally a Baryonyx! But the last volcano scene when they leave is heartbreaking...)2. Jurassic World (the great vision Hammond had in mind comes to life and it's what we all dreamed of. The park is running full force but it's still doesnt feed greedy moneyvores and shit hits the fan pretty hard. Indominous probably could've looked better but the threat was real.. racing a bike through the jungle in the middle of a pack of hunting raptors to chase a Rex/raptor hybrid? Grady's got balls made of adamantium)1. Jurassic Park (the one movie that almost took my life onto a paleonthologist path. I knew every single dinosaurs that ever lived, and when, and where. I was a bit crazy back then. This movie still changed my life cause I am now studying to make special effects and 3D animation. Beyond Nedry's horror screams and Gennaro's last dump. Beyond Muldoon's ""clever girl"" and ""shooooot her!"" This movie had it all and deserves my neverending love for it)"

movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,It’s a fucking T REX!!!!!!
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,you should review creepshow. It's so nostalgic and worthy of a review.
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,"The “They move in herds” line is kind of a tear jerker considering how these people have been studying these animals for years. Imagine if you spent your whole life guessing what an alien did and you not only do you see a live one but you see it do exactly what you spent years thinking, telling yourself and telling others it did"

movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM, @J  Did you watch Preacher? This is why God wiped them out in the first place :)
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,"33:25 I'm sure you're just making a joke, but that one line about them moving in herds actually establishes a huge part of the movie that sadly, the other two are missing; it sets up that the dinosaurs will act like animals and will behave in legitimate ways. And also, it establishes that our main character will anticipate how they'll act when the time comes to fend them off"
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,"100% agree, as well as, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it also fits with the scene and music; since this is somewhat what Dr. Grant has studied his entire life. It's things he has assumed but never been able to prove. So fitfully, it's Dr. Grant finally getting his ""proof"" in a way, it's having his entire career validated  and very well done in my perspective"
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,"or the comment about how he has one daughter but in the other movie he said he had three. he said hes had multiple short lived marriages in the first one and in the second movie kelly says something about ""or do you just like making them"" meaning hos other two kids are by different women and irrelevant to this movie at all"
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,"Only a slight nitpick in the first review but in fairness there’s no way Dr Malcolm would’ve known about the death of the worker or Dennis Nedry, so his statement concerning the deaths of 3 people are accurate as far as he knew."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,"You don’t think he’d find out about those deaths after leaving the island? Like when he discussed what happened with the lawyers or the other survivors? There’s got to be a official report of what happened that was made, that he probably had access to."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM," @Chris Plagge  The first worker was killed before Malcom was on the island, which was the entire reason they were there. They said a worker was killed but didn't say how so he might not have realized it was dino-related. He never met Dennis and had no idea he was on the island at the time of the event."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM," @Zach Hatten  Regardless if Ian knew Dennis or any of these people existed, normally when one signs a gag-order, you are told what you are not allowed to talk about. There are reports of what happened by others. Ian would have signed the NDA/Gag order, as it was referenced in the movie that he broke his NDA. Thus, he would have been aware of the loss of life, etc. More than likely would have spelled out each individual, as well. It was a silly mistake in the movie is all."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,"I think it's logical to say that he was only referring to the lawyer, Mr Arnold, and muldune. It's not obvious that anyone knew that Dennis nedry died."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,"I'm pretty sure the NDA was signed before getting on the island.  There would be no incentive to sign it after he got off the island, but signing a carte blanche NDA before getting on the island seems like something the lawyer would insist on."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM," @powdercowboy90  I'm sure his family/friends/boss never looked for him, or cared to investigate"
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM, @socialdeviant13  good point
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM," @Chris Plagge  the NDA was signed before going to the island, most likely to keep it a secret pre-launch to stop other companies from doing what Denis tried to do. Nothing to do with the deaths afterwards."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM," @Chris Plagge  Nope :) ""What happend to fatboy?"" ""Who cares?"""
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM," @Chris Plagge  The thing about an NDA/gag order is that it cannot be used to stop someone from reporting criminal activity, so he had every right to speak out when he found out the company had lied about it's arguably criminal negligence."

movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM, @deadguy718  it's a service that streams guys reviewing movies for free
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,Good joke 
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,this dude never agewell james looks good as well
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,For the sequels at least. I ain't watching those full length shits
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,Michael Crichton: Writes a phenomenal techno-thriller about dinosaursAlso Michael Crichton: half-asses a sequel because Spielberg wanted a sequel and the check was fatAlso Spielberg: Throws out most of the sequel novel for The Lost World
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,"Actually, The Lost World by Michael Crichton isn’t half assed. It has a lot more action than suspense but there is still a hell of a lot more suspense then the movie. But it is a good book, and that is very much a fact."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,"You want a good book.... ready player one. That movie was garbage in comparison. Seriously, audio book that, even the narrator they got for that was boss. They always say book is better than movie, but this is serious. Do yourself a favor please"
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,"Idk about half assed, from what I've heard it's actually a great book. But he does go on too much about the dangers of cloning"
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,Here is something I don't get Crichton kills Malcolm in jurassic Park then in the  next book the lost world he brings him back?
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM, @Jason Kreider  because of how popular Jeff Goldblum's performance was in the first film maybe? Also because his character was the one that emphasized the dangers of cloning the most
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM, @Jason Kreider  Because Jeff Goldblum was the most popular character from the movie.
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,"Didn't read the book, but had an audio cassette version and it was far superior to the film."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,"To me thats just stupid,you kill someone off only to bring him back? Why not bring back nedry or Hammond for that matter?"
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM, @Jason Kreider  because they weren't as popular or likable in the books I guess?
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM, @Ryan Wesemann  There is no point or purpose in paragonating a film and a book.Totally different kind of works.

movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,"Fun Fact: Jurrasic Park 1 was the only film of the franchise to not use Mercedes Benz Autos. Starting in 97 with the Lost World: Jurassic Park 2 Universal would sign a contract with Mercedes Benz to promote their vehicles. Which is a damn shame as in 96 Ford came out with the Expedition, which could've been the natural sucessor to the Explorers used in the 1st Film."

movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,Kinda like how Frankenstein got turned into an icon of cinema with all those Universal Monster movies?

movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,People love to watch dinosaurs eating people
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,"I pitch a mini series, Jurassic Park. Takes place in 1989 and follows the book more closely."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM," @Jesse Zimmerman  it would probably show very few dinosaurs, instead  it would most likely focus corporate espionage,  legal battles,  murder investigations, and needles sex/violence."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM," @Midnight Raven  yes, In the book, Hammond dies, the lawyer is a badass that helps out the others, Muldoon carries around a rocket launcher and blows up raptors"
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM," @KSound Kaiju  not to mention all the insane scenes. The waterfall scene alone would have been fucking incredible to see on film, can't believe it didn't make it."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM," @KSound Kaiju  yeah the movie really screwed Gennaro. Combined his character with Ed Regis. The movie Lex was a HUGE improvement though to be fair, I actively wanted book Lex to be eaten at least a half-dozen times."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,1:00:05 This part hits different remembering Doug's mom passed on. Doug went a whole year without profanity. There was a nice tribute to the mom when Rachel Tietz came back for a visit.
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,I actually got really sad at that part knowing his mom actually passed away a few years ago.
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM, @Arachné Sakura  yeah. hindisght is really tragic
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,That's so sad. Did he stop swearing for his mom? What reviews did he stop swearing in?
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM, @Nefretiri T  for a year he didn't swear at all
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,"Dude, I remember watching that review and totally forgetting about what happened to his mom. When the ending happened, I started to cry."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,"This was NOT expected. But I'm glad that you made this compilation, your Jurassic Park reviews are my favorite reviews from your channel."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,I couldnt have said it better my self lol
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,I really wish they would put together compilations like this for every franchise they've covered. It was amazing. I've actually somehow managed to miss all their Jurassic reviews. This is an amazing way to see them all in one sitting or two b
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,I certainly hope they would do compilations for other franchises NC’s reviewed.
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,We need more compilations of nostalgia critic episodes. They are nostalgic oddly enough
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,"Well, of course. It's in the name after all. Not like it's ""Contemporary Critic""."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,Actually he only saw 3 deaths The first death was before he came to the island The fifth death he never sees
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,"Well, also the first death wasn't a death. It was mentioned that the guard was gravely injured, but not killed in a throwaway line. And they had no reason to lie about Nedry's death as his fate was unknown. No one found the jeep, so no one confirmed his death."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM, @JumpCuts  Jurassic Park Video Game by TellTale confirm his dead
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,"yeah.  The only deaths he should be aware of are Gennaro, Arnold, and Muldoon.  On a side note, in the JP3 critique, he says Sattler and Grant aren't famous.  They would almost certainly be in the top 5 most famous living scientists by the time JP3 came out."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,"Also in Fallen Kingdom, she doesn't own the park. She was the park manager, so it is unlikely that someone would know her for that reason, inversely however she had become an activist for the saving he dinos side of the debate. So yeah dumb that she can just throw on a hat, but dumb for a very different reason."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,I mean.....reports are a thing. He probably would've read them and known that the body count was higher than what he personally knew about.
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,"Yeah, but nobody is perfect."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM," @Radar Hawk  The point was they were covering things up which is why he spoke up. If they covered up the workers death prior the inviting the specialists(which it sounds like they did) and Nedry was listed as having taken the boat back to the island after sabotaging the park,. Ian(who never met Nedry and wouldn't have known he was at the park after everyone left) would have no way of knowing. 3 makes total sense."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,Even if he didn't personally witness them. He would have knew about them.
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM, @JumpCuts  I'd have actually like to see him come back completely mutilated and still trying to figure out how to make money on the dinosaurs
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,"You know, its hilarious. I never realized until watching this video how Jeff's team acted more like bad guys than the Ingen team did despite the Ingen teams dickish behavior towards the animals."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,I'm surprised you didn't point out how the T.rex literally destroys the Spinosaurus skeleton before fighting the I.rex.
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,Ya like you think a Spino hater would notice and go nuts on it but it's completely ignored?
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,"I don't normally like the skit era of Nostalgia Critic, but their send-up of the John Hammond / Mr DNA scene was hilarious and great quality content"
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,Honestly I managed to enjoy all five moviesTo me the “bad” ones are like x men last standYeah they are flawed but the parts that are good are fantastic But if you dislike them that’s fine
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,I agree with you.  They are still a lot of fun.
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,"Agreed, I find the first one now a little overhyped and the sequels while bad aren't horrible(ignoring lost world), they all are pretty enjoyable in their own way because each of them to me stands out and has their own identity and aren't copy and paste sequels(*cough star wars cough*), while likely an unpopular opinion I hope the series ends after Dominion comes out with little side things and no major movies because I overall like where the series sits right now and I hope Dominion ends on a high note(unlikely considering sequels of the series, the context we have already from the end of Fallen Kingdom and that it is likely rushed), it truely can take only one movie to ruin a bunch of others(look at star wars force awakens was loved by everyone until last jedi came out, while the sequels did technically revive the prequels it also kind of ruined star wars for a lot of people), I just hope that the series ends on at least a decent note."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,Gotta say I’m so happy to see them all in one place! These bring back so many funny memories and I can’t wait to see what you guys’ll do when the last movie comes out!
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,"I just wanna say I still love Jeff Goldblum, he is a national treasure."
movies like Jurassic Park recommend,psRjuO3dQCM,Jeff Goldblum could be reading a grocery list and I would be invested in every single word he says.

movies In the mood for a good cry recommend,MNwNj1K-Jc0,"Extreme Job - If you liked Kung Fu Hustle you'll love this. Easily the best one.Sunny - Great movie, but emotionally draining because you will remember your high school experience.Midnight Runners - Good movie.Exit - Good movie. He changes the venue of his moms birthday to a venue 2 hours away to meet his crush, it's not by chance.Miss Granny - Very good acting, but the ""grandmother"" is completely unlikeable throughout the movie, she learns nothing.Little Forest - Overrated. Very slow and almost a cooking show.My Annoying Brother - Basically the Korean version of Rainman.The Way Home,  Hello Ghost, The Dude In Me, The Beauty Inside,  Inseparable Bros, are on my ""To Watch List"""

It somehow felt that characters were ""stuck"" in these frames: between walls, between neighbors, between social norms, between their spouses' phantoms as you called.

movies In the mood for a good cry recommend,01E5otZCpqw,You could look at it as a double-closed frame: providing two-times the entrapment for the character as a regular closed frame.
movies In the mood for a good cry recommend,01E5otZCpqw,"The frames also need to be seen in conjunction with the rigid social norms of Chinese society, where family, face and reputation is paramount, even over ones' own suffering. Family is forever, whilst you are only one short stage in the timeline.  The framing would have intensified that social aspect even further for a Chinese audience."
movies In the mood for a good cry recommend,01E5otZCpqw,"I can't believe how the director shot this masterpiece without a proper script says art is collaborative while technique is essential a great work from the mediocre is separated in the way that great artists take their art well beyond technique with the use of technique of course and just let ""it"" take its own control and form its own shape and identity because taking control of the art itself would ruin the possibility of it making something else."

Director was literally manipulating into believing that it was her husband. That was the best scene for me in the movie, how it unfolded."
movies In the mood for a good cry recommend,01E5otZCpqw,"Indeed. It was so powerful because the movie had already established the spouses being filmed in the back without showing their faces, so when the scene starts that way we are easily manipulated. Such a brilliant moment."

movies In the mood for a good cry recommend,01E5otZCpqw,"I feel like these frames were meant to symbolize intimacy as well as oppression. It's oppressive because Mrs Chan is afraid of what people will say if they see her together with Mr Chow so these two always stay within the frames but they can't ever break free (from their marriages or from social prejudices).And it's about intimacy too because when I see Mrs Chan and Mr Chow alone within another frame, I feel like what I'm doing is voyeurism. I'm intruding their intimacy. The viewer is basically an outsider but is also part of the movie."
movies In the mood for a good cry recommend,01E5otZCpqw,Yes and in the building you can often hear through the walls as well! You're constantly reminded of the ears behind the walls.

movies In the mood for a good cry recommend,01E5otZCpqw,"I know this analysis is years old, but I still wanna post this comment on the most relevant video about this masterpiece of a movie:This movie effected me very deeply emotionally because it displayed my greatest fear: settling. Not settling down... just settling. I watched my parents do it, I watched my friends do it, I watched my relatives do it. They settled into marriages in which they're unhappy; they're abused, or cheated on, or just miserable, and my greatest fear is that I'll settle for a miserable love life just so that I can have any love life at all, and that I might realize that i DID settle far too late.I might feel real love after already being married to someone I'm indifferent to.And that's what happened to these characters. She's being cheated on, and she stays with her husband. It's doomed.It shattered me.I can't watch this movie more than once or twice in my life because it terrifies me."
movies In the mood for a good cry recommend,01E5otZCpqw,"Years later I came to the OST after a 10 year breakup, most people didnt watch or understood the film and found the melody calming...Im petrified, haunted, trapped by it, its masochistic, its perverse, its terrifying."
movies In the mood for a good cry recommend,01E5otZCpqw,"It helps to let go of this idea that there's one true love out there. This at first sounds bitter but it's not. You can choose who you want to spend your life with and not wait for verification by some symbol. True unconditional love exists between sisters or a mother with her children. But don't feel trapped by finding someone wasn't meant to be your one ans you're stuck with them, some relationships break apart and you can look back and beautiful memories and the idea that it could also have been nothing, but it was something, a dream, for some time."

movies In the mood for a good cry recommend,01E5otZCpqw,"In the Spanish translation (and I'm guessing on the original version, as well) the characters would speak to each other by using pronouns in formal/respectful form; while switching to the familiar form during the re-enactment portions.This subtle touch frames the duality of the relationship between them even further by maintaining the proper social distance while being their ""real"" personas."
movies In the mood for a good cry recommend,01E5otZCpqw,"+NotYourBiggestFan  In Cantonese speech, there is no difference between the formal and familiar form of you.

movies In the mood for a good cry recommend,01E5otZCpqw,"The Chinese language do not have formal or familiar forms other than a few nouns, the way we express our emotions and tonality of the speech dictate the levels of familiarity"
movies In the mood for a good cry recommend,01E5otZCpqw, @k ken  您 (Formal you) is relatively new word and came from Beijin version of 恁 (Plural You) around Yuan dynasty (元朝). So older language like Cantonese (粵) and Ming (閩) doesn't have it. As matter in fact early version of  Kangxi Dictionary (康熙字典) also do not have the word 您. Also since Ming is less influenced by the other major languages  when we speak we still use 汝 and only use 你 in writing.

movies In the mood for a good cry recommend,01E5otZCpqw,The Italian translation of the movie  has this characteristic too.
movies In the mood for a good cry recommend,01E5otZCpqw,"You can still maintain that distance even in Cantonese by avoiding pet names, terms of endearment, given names, etc. You simply say Miss, Mrs, Mr. + Family name.  It's formal and polite and proper. Also you can address someone by a formal title, examples are Doctor,Principal, President etc."
movies In the mood for a good cry recommend,01E5otZCpqw,"I just got back from watching it at the cinema with Spanish subtitles (I'm a native English speaker) and some of the dialogue really threw me for a loop; partly because of what Nerdwriter says in the video, but partly cause of what you're saying ... Everyone mostly refers to each other in the usted form and sometimes it was hard to know if they were talking about the person in front of them, one of their partners, or if they were commenting on them acting as one of the partners. I found it really added to the murkiness of their relationships of the love quadrangle, and I also wondered what it would've been like with English subtitles, or even understanding it in Cantonese."

We often see the characters not as they are, but images of who they are.  Which is what fantasy is: not the real thing, but a twist on the real thing.  Also, mirrors are about examining the self, which is what these characters do.  They are endless examining themselves, their relationship with themselves, and their relationships with their spouses."

movies In the mood for a good cry recommend,01E5otZCpqw,I have seen this movie close to 20 times now. It's my one of fav movies. What makes it aesthetically beautiful is that there are fewer dialogues yet you get immersed in the story. Every frame of the movie looks like a painting. Such painstakingly beautiful movie.I badly wanted both the characters to hook up and get revenge on their respective cheating partners. But they did not and guess that's the beauty . 10/10 would watch again.❤️

movies In the mood for a good cry recommend,01E5otZCpqw,"This is so fantastic! I would love to hear your comments on the seemingly offput ending! To me, it seemed like a play on how though chan and cheung's encounter was a fantasy and has become history, it's about honoring that moment that they had with each other and that even though they moved on with their lives, they can always remember that past like a broken down historical monument. It's definitely an ambiguous one but I think it was perfect in that it really made me go backwards in the movie to find out why it would be there - literally, as a viewer, revisiting the history of the movie itself.

movies In the mood for a good cry recommend,01E5otZCpqw,"initially it was the music which drew me to watch this film ""In The Mood"". Then I was impressed by the photographic approach to scene filming. Very clever. We were the 'fly on the wall*, and the events established themselves by silence, mood and visual angles which often only showed part of the 'bigger scene.'  Your terminology '""frame within a frame"" was a good explanation of what I had also noticed, but which would not have been able to describe so succinctly!  I must admit I didn't understand the first half (or third) of the movie, but when the situation became clearer, everything was brilliantly portrayed, i.e. the love that grows from shared time, but which is constrained by circumstances, and how each of the two people behave and attempt to handle the situation. Thanks for your analysis."

movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,Hi watch mojo
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,I like Disney Hades
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,Hi is u the sussy baka?
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,Stormare!
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,HAHAHAHAHHA
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,HAHAHAHAHHAA
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,HAHAHAHAHAHHAA
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,AHHAHAHAHAHAHAA
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,Anybody who has actually READ Greek mythology knows Hades is NOT the Devil.  But it's not the first time Disney has appropriated something and got it completely wrong.
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,no but you cant deny that hades does feel like a devilish being
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"To add extra irony to it: Of all the gods in the ancient Greek pantheon (especially among the big three, Hades and his brothers Zeus and Poseidon), Hades is probably the nicest and most moral by human standards. Perhaps his worst crime was tricking Persephone into marrying him, which is admittedly pretty scummy (though still leagues better than his horndog brothers who thoughtlessly violate anything with a pulse just because they can), but even then Hades is still kind enough to let her leave the underworld for half of each year to visit her mother Demeter, whose happiness at her daughter's return brings spring and whose sadness at her departure brings winter."
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"Hades is not the devil. He just rules the Underworld; he doesn't control who goes where. The Underworld consists of The Elysian Fields, Asphodel Fields, and Tartarus (heaven, limbo, and hell, if you need equivalents). Three minor gods, Minos, Rhadamanthus, and Aeacus, are the ones who actually make the decision."
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,You had me at Asphodel
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,Viggo Mortensen (The Prophecy) is my top pick as well for conjuring an unbelievably dominating and memorable character for so little screen time.   I'm also a big fan of De Niro (Angel Heart) and Stormare (Constantine) for the same reason:  they somehow stole the show in a few short minutes. Outstanding performances all around.
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,Thumbs up for The Prophecy.
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"You Sir, have a great taste. These are also my Top 3 Picks. ;-)"
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,Agree
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,DeNiro used to stand up in the lattice of walkways that crisscrossed the shooting soundstage's ceiling and watch the film being shot. He would click and drum his long fingernails on the metal railings and would not speak with other members of the cast. He put a super creepy vibe in the air that the whole cast could feel. Method Acting.
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"Peter Stormare in Constantine is by far my favorite devil depiction in movies, because of just how he acts is how I envision the real devil would act like. Another awesome movie depiction of the devil which sadly wasn't in this is Mephistopheles from Ghost Rider played by Peter Fonda."
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,Yes! Didn't like the movie myself but I thought Fonda was great as Mephistopheles!
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"Hades didn’t belong on this list he’s not technically the devil that’s a Christian bibliography, hades is lord of the underworld in Greek mythology, a totally different sentient being."
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"I was about to comment this too. As amazing as he is, he's very different to the devil, I would have put Elizabeth Hurley from Bedazzled in his place."
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,I agree Hades had no business being on this list because he was never a devil and he was never evil people just were afraid of him because they fear death that's why they were afraid of him most people are afraid of death and that's a normal human behavior
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ, @Beklee Dee  exactly 
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"I couldn't agree more, even I am having a hard time believing they thought Hades was a devil."
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ," @Beklee Dee  Or Chernabog from Fantasia, because talk about a creepy devil"
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ, @Gabriela Mallo  oooooh. Thats a great choice!
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"Agreed, Hades was never actually evil, he just rules the underworld, which is where the dead go"
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"he was definitly inspired by satan tho, he had cults worship him an he ruled greeks version of hell, but in greek mythology i think narcissim represents lucifer more then hades"
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,I agree with Viggo Mortensen taking number 1.  I was thinking of him the entire video. 
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,he is a brilliant actor
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,He was creepy as hell too. (Pardon the pun)
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"Agreed, I was going to be pissed if he didn't make the list.  Truly elevated that movie, single-handedly."
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,I can't believe you didn't say Elizabeth Hurley in the remake of Bedazzled... She would have been in my top five.
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"Yeah, why the hell not? She’s like the movie equivalent to Rias Gremory from High School DxD!"
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,She was good but she basically was the same devil they mentioned from bedazzled other than that she was gender swapped because that bedazzled came out before and he did just as good of a job as she did though he was the original
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,She's the epitomy of temptation
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,Agreed!  Liz should have been on the list. She would have been the only female incarnation. The devil would be more inviting if beautiful and bedazzling.
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,Top 20 when the Devil loses list
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"For real tho, her devil had so many layers. Was just thinking about her/that movie few days ago, definitely one of her best performances"
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,I Love Elizabeth Hurley For The Rest Of My Life . I Loved Her In Bedazzled 
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,Exactly!
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,Schwing!!
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"Chernabog from Disney's Fantasia deserves an honorable mention. Walt and his team perfectly captured the animated embodiment of who Satan is, and how he treats souls from the underworld. It made no attempt to be child-friendly whatsoever!"
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,Both Constantine and Prophecy Lucifers are my top two favorites EVER!!!
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"I've got issues with putting Hades on this list, because he's the God of the Underworld, not the Devil...two totally different things here, and Hades is actually one of the nicer Olympian gods/goddesses"
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"Sooo, disagree heavily with Hades on the list. Even in the disney version. Hades was not the Greek version of the devil. There was plenty of other options to put in that slot."
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"hades:*doesn't cheat on his wife* *is the god of the underworld not dead"" ""genially one of  of the better Olympians""christians: underworld? so the devil?"
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,He did kinda….kidnap his wife….But very valid points compared to Zeus’ deeds
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ," @Luna Organa  Well, kidnapping someone’s bride was less frowned upon in Ancient Greece, and depending on what version you read, Zeus actually okayed the kidnapping in the first place, behind Demeter’s back (aka, the og helicopter parent)"
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"Hades did cheat on Persephone, twice if not more, but because of Adonis - I’d like to think they have an open marriage"
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"Hades is not the devil, He is a god"
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ," @laura lugo  yes, Hades is a god"
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ, @Luna Organa  She's also his niece!
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ, @Elizabeththegreatest  And Hera is Zeus Sister. They are all messed up on that one.
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ," @drakmendoa  In fact, Herc isn't Hera's son, he's the product of Zeus's affair with Alceme!"
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ," @Elizabeththegreatest  I did not say anything different. o.ODoesn't change the fact, that Hera is the sister of Zeus."
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,Was waiting for Liz Hurley's portrayal to be mentioned :(
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"Me too honestly, I had no idea it was a remake"
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,and me
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,Thank you! That was the first one i thought of
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"The Prophecy (or God´s Army here in Germany) is one of my favourites. I mean C´mon, Viggo Mortensen as Lucifer and Christopher Walken as Gabriel!"
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"Hades wasnt like The devil he just was god of all dead, he ruled heaven and hell, his job was not let dead people out and alive people in"
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,Had to scroll too much for this!
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,Thank you.. I was kinda thrown by his inclusion on this list.
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"I'm content with ""Constantine"" being number 3, because Viggo did make an amazing devil in ""Prophecy."" What I'm disappointed about is that the devil from ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" didn't even make the list. The devil embodied by an innocent-looking and sounding little girl? I got chills the first time I ever saw that movie because I knew instantly who 'she' really was, and it was such a great twist. It was also a reminder that evil can come in the most unexpected of packages."
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,Yes Viggo was amazing with his few short moments. Calm but creepy and intimidating in such a quiet way.  Tim Curry is solid #2 for me. He scared me so badly in that role as a kid.
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,Satan from 'South Park' voiced by Trey Parker.
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"Hades is not the devil in any way, he is just the god of death"
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,I agree. replace that with Clarence Williams III in Tales From the Hood.
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ," @Chris Rose  Yes, you are right"
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"Before ever seeing the movie, in my mind as a kid, I always pictured the devil to look EXACTLY how Tim Curry was designed in Legend. When I first saw that movie it was like they ripped the image straight from my head."
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"I'm so glad you topped the list with my personal favorite.  Viggo stole the entire movie with his protrayal, the writing was masterful and the acting full of malice and hate and... well... evil.  I don't know that anyone else has ever captured the role as perfectly as that. His speech about humanity is chilling and magnificent and, quite frankly, Viggo Mortensen's Lucifer alone makes the movie worth watching."
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,Yes…Angel Heart one of my very favorites…it was such a different movie when it came out .
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,Viggo Mortensen in The Prophecy is truly unsettling and yeah it’s Viggo Mortensen.
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"Y'all missed the devil in Tales From the Hood. He was something, plus funny as ever. The actor that played him passed away like a month ago."
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,Viggo Mortensen( prophecy) is the best by far. 
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"I was practically salivating to comment: Viggo Mortensen as Lucifer in Prophecy. I was sure he'd be overlooked, but thank Dog I watched till the end. Great list and the best Devil is at #1."
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"Very, very disappointed not to see George Burns as Harry O. Tophet in ""Oh God, You Devil"" on this list."
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"YES! I'm so glad Viggo Mortensen's portrayal got recognized in this video, at #1 no less. I might've liked to have seen Daniel Radcliffe's Iggy Parrish in ""Horns"" be on this list but overall, I'm satisfied with the top picks."
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,The one on the movie Legend was the best looking Devil
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,Angel Heart is such an underated movie!!  Tim Curry's Darkness was my favorite.
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,I just realized would Night on Bald Mountain's devil be on this list? I know that one was kind of creepy when I was young
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"""Devil's Advocate"" is one of my favorites"
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"Viggo in Prophecy was my favorite as well, followed closely by Peter Storemare in Constantine."
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"Damn, no Clarence Williams III? He traumatized me. RIP."
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"Sees thumbnail, likes video. My favorites are definitely the ones played by Tom Waits, Harvey Keitel, Peter Stomare, Tim Currey, Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, and the ones shown in the movies ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut"", ""The VVitch"", ""Tenacious D"", and also a shout-out to ""Time Bandits""."
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,The most scariest was the one you're never seen in Rosemary's Baby
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,Honestly I loved the ranking for each one of these devils I still need to see the Robert de Niro devil but I have seen the prophecy devil and I freaking love to have how little scenery he needed but he still exude in charisma and the definite effects of being a devil he's truly one of my top favorite devils
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"Ive been saying it for years, the prophecy is an amazing movie."
movies about devils recommend,V-9cN3hitzQ,"I hoped for Malcolm McDowell's Devil from ""Suing the Devil"" to be on the list. His court speech is a masterpiece."
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"Viggo’s was excellent, but Peter Stormare takes the win for me in Constantine.  He’s got ten minutes of screen time to show you why he’s the most terrifying thing you can imagine, and he pulls it off effortlessly, without the benefit of an entire film to do it."
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"Dave Grohl is how everyone want's the devil to be an absolute metalhead. Al Pacino was perfect as the sardonic devil. Peter Stormare was perfect as the sadistic almost playful devil yet extremely intimidating. Viggo Mortensen......is just perfect lol the voice, the delivery, the darkness, the creepy one-liners etc..."
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,AL Pacino’s portrayal is the most biblically accurate of how Satan operates.
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,Lol
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,I'm just getting warmed up
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,cadkls the edge is extreme
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk, @Goat   Extremely cringeworthy.  Let's hope he doesn't cut himself on that razor-sharp edge
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk, @cadkls  you clearly haven't actually done proper research
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"It's personally my favorite, because it gets deeper into what meaning of the devil is, especially to human nature. It's not horror, or grotesque, dangerous in it's own form, it his influence, and the choices you make. But then again, that's more personal, and I think that's something that scares a lot more people.Sure, I love a lot of these devils, some because of their costumes and look, or their menacing forms and energy, but I personally love the idea of a devil where it's not about the devil, but about their influence on other people.Like with the kid who said 'screw you',  instead of hitting him with a bus, give him the choice to run over someone else to get himself away or get out his anger out on.I personally find the idea of the devil intriguing, I'm not a believer in God or the Devil, but I believe in choices, and find it interesting in what people consider good or evil, and how I sometimes miss the grey areas in this."
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,Terry Killa that’s extremely racist....
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,Also the best
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,Peter Stormare in Constantine is by far the most convincing and best rendition of the devil.
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,Hello
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"Al Pacino single handedly saved Devil's Advocate from being a complete, and utter mess."
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,Are you saying you don't like it when Keanu does an accent in a movie?
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk, @James Teegardner  Lol! Exactly! Watch Bram Stoker's Dracula where he acted alongside Gary Oldman. Keanu's english accent is so bad it almost singlehandedly ruined the movie.... Almost... 
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"I guess that you could say that he did a ""Devil"" of a job doing that!"
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"I felt Pacino was just playing himself in the film, but that didn't stop his performance from being engrossing to watch."
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"Mark Pellegrino's Lucifer in 'Supernatural' was pretty damn good, too."
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,I agree.  He should get Hades spot since Hades isn't Lucifer.
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,Not really in my opinion not worthy of top ten.
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk," @Johnwayne Wireman  Well, just my opinion. You gotta admit though, the ""tormenting of Sam"" part in his first season as Satan was pretty good. The character wussed out later on, especially after his son was born. I base my opinion on the better written parts for Pellegrino's Lucifer."
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk, @Eric X  he had this entitlement to the character but it saturated the sarcastic vibe because of Crowley' who was a way better devil in my opinion. Lucifer by Tom what's his face was great tho. But I think the devil an EVE  where 2 roles supernatural really messed up I'm a huge fan of the show
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk," @Johnwayne Wireman  True, Crowley's character was ""a better Satan than Satan""."
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk, @Eric X  not trying to take away from dudes performance but Crowley' damn near should have been a mention James woods played Hades not Satan  ya feel me
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk," @Johnwayne Wireman  No kidding, Mark Sheppard's Crowley was perhaps a better Satan than ""Satan""... a powerful performance indeed! He would definitely make the top-5 ""evil characters"" list in any format."
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,AGREED!!!!
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD MORNING VIETNAAAAAAAAAAMi love this guy
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,just gona say that
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,Hades isn't the devil. Learn your Greek mythology.
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"I was so worried Viggo's Lucifer would be left out, but then he was no.1! I loved his portrayal to such a subconscious extent, that I, to this day, find myself humming ""but like all true love..."", at any given time and for absolutely no apparent reason :-D That's like 20 years of devotion to the portrayal of this character, people!"
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"Nothing beats Tim Curry's ""The Darkness"" every line he uttered was epic!  Another that should be mentioned in this list is the Devil in Crossroads.  Oh and of course Ron Perlman as Satan from The Last Supper but hey sorry that is a SPOILER"
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,You forgot to mention Clarence Williams III and his diabolically good performance as Mr Simms from Tales from the Hood as it shows how deceptive Satan can be playing with his prey until he reveals his true evil self in all his terrifying glory
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"When Goldblum is asked “so in fact, who are you?” And he subtly looks down to signify he is from hell is just FANTASTIC acting."
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,Tim and Al both killed it as the devil. Some of the top devil's you mentioned had Keanu  Reeves as the protagonist. Him and Al Pacino's back and forth was one of the greatest moments of any movie.
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,Gabriel Byrne's performance was easily the best thing about End of Days. You could tell he REALLY enjoyed playing that roll! Likewise with Pacino in Devil's Advocate.
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"You guys finally got one right! Mortensen was the best portrayal of the devil, by a mile. Cool, quiet, and, menacing all at the same time."
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,Tim Curry's Darkness scared the shit outtve me as a kid. Takes my number 1 spot for sure.
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"Haha. I agree! I knew all his lines, word for word, way back when.  lol"
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"Darkness 100%, I even bought the [expensive] 20+ inch talking figure. ""Even a Wolf Suffers Fleas"", classic."
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,Keanu is the official devil handler 
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,AlmighyMon TheSiixth nah jack black and Kyle gass are
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk, @PS4Fan  strongly disagree with you!
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,B&N Ferguson oh? Did Keanu challenge him to a rock off? Did Keanu knock his horn off A) saving the human race b) making a replacement for the pick of destiny? No
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk, @PS4Fan  He did sort of save humanity by foiling Gabriel's plan AND sacrified his very own life for Isabelle to go to heaven. Plus he got a kickass cross-shaped shotgun
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk, @Michael Desmarais  also flipped Satan off and tricked him into fixing his lungs from cancer

movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,Satan being the head of a law firm is easily the most believable portrayal ever
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,.....as a lawyer is a politician in training
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"Honestly nah lawyers arent that evil a lot of them are actually really good, i think it would fit more if he was a politician not even a too powerful one just one doing nothing."
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,That or a politician
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"Al Pacino is #1 Any role he plays is just perfect.Gangster, cop, devil, football coach, blind vet. Anything, he kills it."
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"Look, I like Pacino's portrayal too but for the most part he just banks on the fact that he can raises the volume of his voice and people will think he's dramatic."
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk," @Spiral Feather  lol, is that how you really feel? I see him as an actor, probably the best or top 3 ever, as absolutely perfect. Anything he plays. Not just, raise his voice and be dramatic or whatever that was...But it's cool, I respect your opinion.Cheers "
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"I rather liked Lucifer in Constantine. It was everything I've always imagined he would be if he were real. Smooth talking, charming, manipulative, sarcastic, and gleefully sadistic, You really could believe that he could talk someone out of their soul with ease. The tar was also an amazing addition to his design."
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,Lucifer in Constantine has always been my favorite. He did a fantastic job
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"Okay, you DEFINITELY get an A-plus for putting Viggo at the top of the list. His portrayal of Lucifer is definitely the most unforgettable!"
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,Nope!  I agree with Vigo Mortinsons place but how could you pass up Deniro’s portrayal in Angel Heart?  That could easily beat out South Park or Bedazzled hands down
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,Tim Curry as Darkness is the best one in my opinion
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"Peter Stormare in Constantine, for the reason said in this video; his wicked calm. In my opinion that is what makes him so appealing in his role."
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,I loved Lucifer from Constantine. He probably would have gotten number 1 if he was in the movie for more than one scene
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"Really glad to see Constantine's devil on this list, my wife and I fawn over that portrayal from time to time. That movie may not have been all awesome, but that is the best portrayal of Satan ever made. He's perfect, from his costume to his calm demeanor, so clean with the black ooze dripping from his feet. Perfect."
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,Tim curry as Darkness hands down #1 portrayal of satan.
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"I love Darkness, he is such a fabulous diva. Almost as much as Hades. And Lucifer from Constantine was brilliant as well. I haven't seen Prophecy... I'll remedy that."
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"My favorites are Lucifer (Passion of the Christ) and Darkness (Legend). Darkness is a very dark and deep character, and Lucifer always scared me with his androgenous appearence."
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"Great list. I was SO hoping for ""The Prophecy"" to take the #1 spot! LOVE that underrated film."
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"Constantine may have had Shia LaBeouf, but Tilda as Gabriel and Peter Stormare as Lucifer were totally worth that movie."
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,I love how Satan in the Devil's advocate is aliased as John Milton. Same name as the author of Paradise Lost.
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,Darkness has the best devil hands down. I remember that movie from when I was a kid. I really believed that’s what the devil really looks like.
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,Liz Hurley is great as the devil in the remake of bedazzled.
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"My personal favorite portrayal of the devil is Emmanuelle Seigner in ""The Ninth Gate"". Though the character is unnamed, the implication is intense and it is the only time I can think of outside of little Nikki where the devil actually gets his/her way"
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"Viggo was one of the best in my opinion. He was good looking but super creepy and Lucifer is supposed to be the most beautiful of the angels. I could also totally see Jack Nicholson as a devil, charming and crazy! "
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"And honestly i wouldn't really consider Hades a devil. In the Disney film 'Hercules', sure he's the villain, but naturally his job is to take care of all the souls, not just the evil ones, alongside his wife Persephone. He's allowed up to Olympus and (in the myths) does not start trouble. He doesn't bring death he just takes care of it."
movies about devils recommend,ntesLFSV5pk,"""No Ego"" Viggo does do the best job. Seductive yet powerful, he's got the best lines in the film. ""Humans, and how I love you talking monkeys for this, know more about treachery and seduction of the spirit..."" His roar at one of the demons is taken directly from the Gospel of Peter, who describes him as ""Wandering the earth, roaring like a lion"""

movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,I been binging these videos all week
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,The film is based on the historical account of Grandier's downfall by Aldous Huxley called The Devils of Loudun. This Ken Russell's masterpiece is unforgettable. Oliver Reed was brilliant in this and so were the others.  Hope it gets reissued on 4k blu ray
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"Came here to make the same comment. Unfortunately, Huxley's work, in particular his earlier works, is not very well known outside of Brave New World which, sadly, has been eclipsed - in terms of dystopian futures - by 1984. Huxley's vision is far more elaborate and sneakily less ""obvious"" than Orwell's masterpiece (don't get me wrong, I'm a massive fan and, dare I say, advocate of Orwell's works). The government ruling through control of pleasure (sex, drugs and even intelligence) is just as probable as ruling through fear, it's just that we've never seen it realised the way Fascism or Communism has nearly come to be in our world."
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,Wait so did the judges actually dress like the kkk with the triangle hoods?
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o," @Mannequia  I think priests or monks did that in Spain, probably before the KKK existed.It's definitely tied to Catholicism and Spain (maybe Iberia/Portugal too) so maybe it has something to do with the Inquisition?"
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o," @Raoul Duke  i mean I figured it was more like the kkk based their outfit on catholicism but I wanted to be sure that was how they actually looked, so thank you for the information"

movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"I managed to watch a partially restored version of the movie with the rape of Christ scene intact. It was really difficult to watch but I feel perfectly exemplified the insanity of the situation taking place.For anyone interested in learning more about the events the movie is based on check out The Devils of Loudun by Aldous Huxley, it's an amazing non-fiction account of the political assassination of the character Grandier and how the authorities used the hysteria about witchcraft to destroy his reputation and life."
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,Why it was difficult to watch? Only reason I can come up with is the restored footage was bad quality.
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,The fully restored version was shown on UK TV about 20 years ago as part of channel 4 banned season. It has never been shown since. This is where the bootleg originates from. We might never see a full version as Warner brothers may never sign off on it.
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,I remember watching it but couldn't think where it when I'd seen it! Thanks for that see I'm not going that mad through lockdown!👍

movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,I think that’s disrespectful and I feel angry that people decided to make a dumb movie with that scene in it 😡
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,This is one of those movies where the over the top style actually suits the story and real life events that it portrays (even with the embellishments and obvious surrealism).
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,Exactly
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,Oliver Reed was a babe. The fact that this is banned. It makes you feel like what are they hiding. With all the shit in the world. This art is banned.
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,Powerful institutions like to do shit like that in order to cover any negative exposure of their history. Luckily the internet now exists and it's much easier to find this gem.

movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o, @The FM Club  The two I mentioned are my favorites.
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,(Twists mustache in your direction)
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"Oliver Reed was a magical actor. I wish he was remembered more for his work, than for his oh so human frailties. This film disturbed the heck out of me, but it is incredible. And Urban Grandier really existed. His story is terrible, Russell did it justice here."
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"I agree, love anything Oliver Reed did; my first exposure to him was as Bill Sykes in Oliver, later on I got to see him in various Hammer films, and I remember seeing him in The Brood. Phenomenal actor."
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,I was fortunate to see this film in a small Toronto art house movie theatre almost 50 years ago.
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,Do you remember which one? I'm local :)
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o," @Nocturnal Flare  It was Cinecity at Yonge and Charles.  There, the New Yorker and the Revue on Roncesvalles were some of my go-to cinemas.  I live in Peterborough now and our only art house theatre closed down years ago :-("
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,Do you recall how you felt while watching the film?
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,This movie looks like it could have been made this year.  But it was made in 1971.
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,Very crisp picture indeed.
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"Solid review for an amazing movie. Top stars, a real story, and disturbing as shit, in part BECAUSE it's real."
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,Thank you for the kind words bro👍. I agree I'm still mind blowned how this actually happened and I never learned it in a history class.
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"Father Grandier is standard fare among the folks into witchcraft, it always makes me wonder about the stories that got stifled."
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o," @Milos Miletic   Its a movie so I would think it reasonable to agree. Not the sex crap. Catholic nuns?  Come on.  But the burning peeps. Terrorists do that shit today yet. I try not to be too bigoted with the churches though (not implying you are in any way, just as a note). A church is the people within it. Not the pedophile rings that infiltrate it, or some of these sick fucks in charge from the past. Like ya said, damn happy I wasn't alive back then....or grew up in the wrong country even today."
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"""So the nobleman just exposed everything going on there was complete bullshit, it was all an act, and the shocking thing was [they?] didn't do anything. Everybody kept going along with it, though everybody shared a laugh about it all. I could not be more glad I was not born in that time period.""Idk, that scene seems pretty damn familiar to me, I could switch a few nouns around and make it sound like it was written today. Replace the church with the government, the priests and nobleman as certain politicians, the nuns and other people gathered citizen members of political parties, the possession certain beliefs amongst the people, the nonexistent vial of blood an important political promise, it all feels like something I've seen before. People having false beliefs that are dispelled to the raucous laughter of people with opposing beliefs? Definitely familiar. Dangerous extremist views? Yep. Dirty tricks? For sure. Exploitation? This all feels very this period in time to me."
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"yeah, i thought that was a strange comment considering the name of his account, maybe he never really went into the hole"
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o," @Mark Fleener  Tbh I felt the same way about his Shining Skin video, he dismissed the imagery as just shock shlock, but I could see the message in the movie, and I'd never even heard of it before. It wasn't that deep, I left a message there too, interpreting the film and his commentary. I'm going to stay subbed but I hope he starts actually diving headfirst into film critique, instead of just summarizing a plot and adding commentary he clearly didn't fact check or research, dismissing often critical imagery and themes as if they're irrelevant or just to shock people."
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"Growing up Christian, dating an athiest was the best thing to happen to me. My resentment of religion and what it has always done to people is revolting. I’m glad I’m with someone who expresses those feelings and helped me process my feelings"
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,I say this because most of the Conservative party is fueled by disgusting fundamentalist views and people suffer so much due to religious beliefs
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"I saw ur analysis on another video of this channel and i rlly enjoyed it, thank you for this analysis too!!"
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"Sort of like a religious George Orwell 1984. 1984 is not about Communism completely but all dystopian regimes of that day. Stalin, Hitler, and Mussolini have a lot in common. Mussolini was the Italian who invented the word fascism and allied with Hitler."
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"This is the era I grew up in, there were some seriously bizarre films made then. I wonder if a film like that could even be made today... but that's an entirely different discussion. Great review!!"
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"You do know the nun with the hump was Vanessa Redgrave, Liam Neeson’s mother in law? Her daughter was Natasha Richardson, who tragically died after a skiing accident. Her other daughter is Joely Richardson, whom you might have seen in films like EVENT HORIZON."
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,Also the tudors
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,Also Max from Mission Impossible. She comes from a very prominent family of actors.
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"Interesting to note that the The Devil's director Ken Russell also directed Venessa Redgrave's daughter, Joely Richardson, as the main role in his 1993 TV Mini-series 'Lady Chatterly's Lover'."
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o," @The Absurd Platypus  Oh yeah, I’d forgotten that...And he had directed Natasha as Mary Shelley in GOTHIC in 1987, about the night FRANKENSTEIN was conceived."

movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"If this is the most controversial film ever, then the movie Caligula (1979) was a close second."
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"Caligula, a clockwork orange, etc...definitely are up there, I mostly come to that conclusion due to how enraged the Vatican was and how much the film had scenes removed in order to be publicly released"
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,Believe it or not just recently I watched the whole uncut version on YouTube.
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o, @Rabbit Hole Entrance  A clockwork orange? That isn’t that shocking besides the rape scenes
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o, @The Shah of Iran  and that’s your opinion. It will always be regarded as a disturbing film regardless
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o," @Sara McRoberts  I’m not denying that, it’s just so tame compared to most disturbing movies"
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o," @The Shah of Iran  i agree, i find clockwork orange an unimpressive movie"
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o," @Malice  I wouldn’t say unimpressive, I love the movie actually, it’s just tame"
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o, @1 Life  where?
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o," @Rabbit Hole Entrance  Are you familiar with Marian Doras ""Angels Melancholy""? That one is the most messed up thing ive seen recently"
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,Salo is number one for me
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"An absolute Masterpiece, Reed was a force of an actor!"
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,Absolutely. He was magnificent.
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"An interview about the film was talked about and it was made around the time of The Troubles in Ireland. Which was a long conflict between Protestants and Catholics. Im half Irish, brought up in England so its interesting that those horrible times inspired the making of the film"
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"If it was it was inspired badly considering The Troubles weren't about religion and were started due to an extremely biased overwhelmingly Unionist Protestant police force colluding with loyalist gangs to heavily crack down on the Republican catholic civil rights movement for housing, employment and education.Also I doubt The Troubles inspired it considering the film was officially announced and began production before the British army were deployed and the troubles began in August 1969."
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"The film is magnificent; vigorous, inspired, alive, grotesque, passionate, earnest, poetic, etc. etc. One of the greatest of its decade; terribly misunderstood and typically mishandled by the studio. There's really no reason to keep it under wraps given all the crazier stuff that's out there now. Russell was a stylist and the film is full of anachronism, which is part of Russell's wicked sense of humor. Reed as Grandier is sensational -- one of the great performances of the screen -- a complicated character, very good and very bad, but ultimately heroic. It's superb."
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"Saw this in 1971 with my boyfriend in Leeds, when I was 20. I was so traumatised by the time we left the cinema, I couldn't speak for ages. Neither of us could. I'd be curious to know how it would affect me now, 50 years later."
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"I fell in love with this film the first time i watched it. It's Ken Russel's best work and Oliver Reed's too. Grandier is so flawed and self-aware of his own failures as a human, that you give him a pass, because rather than gaslight, he accepts and acknowledges his flaws. He's like most of my friends, both male and female. Urbain Grandier, what a man and a hero. He never gave in, even under torture. RIP."
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,Where can I watch it?
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o, @Ancksunamun  You should be able to download it off of Amazon.
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,The Boyfriend and Women In Love are equally as great !
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"The film has connections to Black Narcissis (1947) by Powell & Pressburger (Ken Russell was a big fan) in which a nun's firey sexuality cannot be repressed and she responds by manifesting ""madness."" I also see an aesthetic connection to ""Eyes Wide Shut"" with the o*gy scenes and masks. Great review"
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"Why blur out ""ORGY""  it is a real word. Learn it, people do it... Grow up."
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"As of March 2021, this is streaming on Shudder. It is the cut version, but still effective. I was surprised how intriguing the story of Grandier was. For me the main takeaway was the abuse of power from the micro to macro level."
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,I wanna see the satanic oregy
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,I saw this movie in Manhattan back in the 1970s down in the Village. Was definitely a heavy movie and freaky.
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"I had heard about this movie over the years. I had no idea it was such a well made production. The fact that it was banned gives you an insight into the hypocrisy that holds sway in the world. Because things like this happened. Even if the movie is not 100% historically accurate, the fanaticism of those times produced atrocities like this. One minor question: I see a guy wearing eye glasses. Did they have those in the 1600s?"
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"Kem Russell had a great run in the 70s and early 80s.The devils, tommy and altered states are awe inspiring visually.Were directors better then??Or did they have the producers who were more interested in art over profit?Bit of both l think"

movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,The power of every single shot is just incredible. And that ending is incredibly moving. Wow.
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"I've been so lucky to see the movie when it came out in the early 70ies, and I think there has hardly been another film making such an impression on me; yes, the Roman Catholic church is one of the most vile institutions on earth, ironically in the same country founded as the Mafia, and it's influence is still notable and destructive in so many countries"
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"Actor Murray Melvin (Father Mignon) recently stated that he wants the epitaph on his tombstone to read: ""I was in The Devils."" It's a great film, one of my favorites, but as you say, not easy to watch. It's like a Hieronymous Bosch painting come to life, both fantastic and horrifying at the same time. Oliver Reed's best performance. Ken Russell is far and away my favorite director. (RIP, Ken.) And thank you for such a perceptive and intelligent review!"
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"I met Oliver Reed many years ago and he was elegant and charming and very, very funny.  This and Women in Love (also directed by Ken Russell) are , I think, his best performances.  We lost him far too soon."
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"Oliver Reed was one that old school of brilliant actors who were simply a force of nature, they burned bright and burned out. I always loved this movie for it's art style  and atmosphere, I had it on VHS, maybe still do somewhere in the loft or something, Ken Russel's style here is perfect"

movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"I would love to see this movie.  All great actors and actresses. It's a shame that we do not have the freedom to watch what we want in this modern day. Unfortunately, if it's against the Catholic church, they cover it up and hide it away, which is proof in itself that the catholic church is exactly what people claim it to be."

movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"I saw this movie on TV as a kid and it blew me away. Years after, I downloaded it from somewhere but lost it in a PC crash. I want to have it again. This is a most disturbing, but fascinating movie."
movies about devils recommend,Q5G3OMyVn_o,"I remember seeing Mark Kermode's restored version on Channel 4 many years ago with the accompanying documentary. Absolutely breathtakingly great film, one of the most groundbreaking British films and an ending far more shocking than the inferior Wicker Man. Murray Melvin as Mignon is superb, as is the entire cast. The Devils is utterly over the top throughout, shocking and genuinely disturbing and difficult to watch in places. All of which are great reasons to watch it."

movies about devils recommend,LycwGKdVR1M,This can bring out the evil in us. Who doesn't want to get even with those who have wronged them? They say the Devil appears as something you have always wanted. Scary.

movies about devils recommend,LycwGKdVR1M,I don't want to get even with them. Especially not that way.
movies about devils recommend,LycwGKdVR1M,I remember seeing this movie years ago! It is so good! I didn’t feel bad for any of those bullies I felt sorry for Ursula though that book made her so damn crazy and sickly looking...and Dominique too she definitely didn’t deserve the ending she got
movies about devils recommend,LycwGKdVR1M,I remember loving this crazy movie as a teenager. Boy oh boy lifetime was lit back in the day. A suburban mom catches her Virgin daughter lighting a yankee candle and all of a sudden she's the devil.

movies about devils recommend,LycwGKdVR1M,"Good little movie. Though sad, spot on regarding how we as kids put our classmates in social categories. Unlike in this film, the cheerleaders at my high school were all great people. No attitude or drama. But the actors nail it as far as those people in school who thought they were cool and above everyone else. In reality they were all losers and NOT people you wanted as friends. Wouldn't have your back and stab your in the back at the first chance. 30 years later at my 30th HS reunion, one of these ""cool"" girls asked me why I never asked her out and I said because you were a stuck up bitch back then and still are."

movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,LAIKA was created by the out of this world Adam Fair and his talented team. Be sure to check out LAIKA's website to keep up with the project: https://laikashortfilm.com/
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,That was some great acting. The cosmonaut nailed it. Great intro into a horror movie. Good work guys.
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,Great story!
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,Very good
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,What you do comes back and haunts you? Karma?
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo, @jonas eggen  Exactly. I think that's true for individuals AND nations. Karma is cold and unforgiving...
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo," @Suga Daddy  I was guessing that this film had to do with Putin. Anyway, I also guess that with your name you will get loads of candy and chocolate  one day."
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,"In the sequel, Oleg survives, but authorities don’t believe him, while Laika begins to roam…….."
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,"I always enjoy all the technical details, and these were well done here... But the main thing that struck me, is this is a very strange, unique film, and I am left wondering many things afterwards..."
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,what is the name of the actor !!!???
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,So... Laika gets a Negative Spirit from Doom Patrol.
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,Loved this short film. Would like to see more to this story.
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,Don't hold your breath for a plausible story for that drivel.
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,Packed so much into 7 minutes - film making at its best - keep up the good work - no more animals in space please (Yes I know there have been many others)
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,I'm sure there's rats and mice that have been treated much better during their time in space.
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,"This is, on every level, the best short I've seen on this channel in a long, long time. It had a real story that actually made sense, short and to the point, without the need for corny exposition or pointless character development. Good acting, good writing, the sound and special effects were really well done, and a great reveal that actually made sense (I can't stress that part enough)."
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,Great imagination. You could make many great films or however you wish to share your imagination. Please keep going I loved this one and I'm sure I'll love the next one. Thank you.
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,"Laika, 64 years ago:  ""I'll be back"" (in Arnold's voice)"
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,A pretty gripping thriller. Can only imagine if it were a full length film!
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,It could not be a full length film because there is no plausible explanation for the events. It is not science fiction.
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo," @Mort Kebab  it csn be a full length film if laika was found by aliens, biologically enhanced to become an immortal (not invincible) android and sent back to Earth as an ambassador to the aliens. There is no explanation for the events? A full length film can make them. Please don't comment when you hardly know about what sci fi is."
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo, @Mort Kebab  you don't strike me as an expert on the subject. So I stand by my post.
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,"I did a book report in 7th grade on Laika.I think it's great that someone remembers that famous canine.Good job , I was glued to the screen every second it even sounds better with headphones on I didn't look for any flaws or discrepancies I'm sure you'll have your critics you know what they should look in the mirror once again good job"
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,Everyone knows about Laika…and we will never forget the sheer cruelty of what they did to her…NEVER.
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,Love these short stories and the effort invested in producing them.
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,Really excited to have our film 'Laika' screening on Dust. I'm the writer/director and hope you enjoy our take/twist on this small part of space history! Happy to answer any questions you have about the film.
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,Only question is will there be more?! Really loved what you did with this. My all time top favorite Dust movie!
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,Great work Adam keep it up looking for more
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo, @ZeeGee Sims  thanks! I haven’t decided what Laika might get up to yet. I do like to think that the Cosmonaut survived though!
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,"This film was just amazing, really great story and directing"
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,"One of the best I've seen. Great acting, terror and well filmed"
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,"Interesting, it is an amazing achievement to be sure. I like the spin of this short film of what happened to Laika for sure."
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,"as a boy being right into the space thing as a xennial could be  learning about the sad story of Laika was particularly disturbing at how little care scientist treat those that are their ""Test"" subjects"
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,"This was very good in all aspects!  Dind't feel like a short. Really nice, hope to see more of your excellent work, Adam Fair."
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,One of the best short films I’ve seen on Dust. And that’s saying a lot
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,Excellent short film-brilliantly shot and acted. Congrats to all involved in it I was gripped from the start.
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,Another awesome sci-fi on the Dust platform!! Great job!
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,"That was great - looked, acted and sounded top-notch, good concept and story too!"
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,"Very interesting short movie, I loved It!"
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,"Oh, man, I have so much love for pets, dogs cats, even turtles.  I knew the animals sent to space were meant to suffer and die - because the instruments of the day could not measure well enough.  When I heard the pitiful whine of beautiful Laika I had to stop watching.  This is fiction, so it could have any outcome - but in real life, the dog(s) shot into space suffered severely and were probably injured by the acceleration, and deceleration and died for any number of reasons.  That is too cruel for me.  I hope the fictional ending is better than real life, but I'm not sticking around to find out."
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,"I just saw it and loved it, keep making movies and telling stories Dust ."
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,Great cinematography and acting. Love it.
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,"And that, my friends, is when the world literally done gone to the dogs."
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,It was very impressive. Please continue to make a lot of good works!
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,"Ok, that was the creepiest thing I've seen on here in a long time....I loved it!"
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,I LOOOOOVVVVVEEEEE this short story!!!! Well done!!!!
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,"This is so good. Only one little thing. Right at the beginning when Laika is shown taking off. That was from Baikonur, which is flat as an ironing board. No hills, nothing."
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,Excellent thrillpower! Top drama - going to watch more of these!
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,"Different, impressive and damn well done presentation. Big"
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,"Huh... So this is how the zombiepocalypse started. Serves us right, throwing our stuff around in space like we do."
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,I don't think she's meant to be undead.
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,"Smart mystery scifi story!Again could given some further details about LAIKA, sowould be nice to see the prequel at some point."
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,Absolutely wonderful and terrifying. Great idea. So many things in few minutes.
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,It's criminal that these films don't get enough traffic
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,"There are 2.8 million subscribers. Right now, first day it's at 30,000+ views. What's ""enough traffic""? Not trolling, just trying to understand your statement. In regards to DUST, I'd say they get pretty good traction from what I can see."
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo," @Jack Williams  Take a channel like William Osman for example. He has 2.6 million subscribers. His videos consistently get over a million views within a week of posting. With how many hours are spent making these movies, rendering shots, and even animating for some of the DUST shorts, its just surprising to me.Edit: The last DUST film to get over a million views was 7 months ago."
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo," @Martin Zachry  Martin that was a damn fine response and of course you know I have to ask, what do you think William has that DUST doesn't? I had to scroll up, they've got 2.8 million subs. Additionally, now I of course have to go out to William's channel and see what's up over there... Admittedly I'm a hard core sci fi fan. I've read much, and it's my favorite, as of course, I'm a technologist, however, I'm a fan of many genre's.I have to say too. DUST reminded me this last pandemic  (2years, geez) how artful a ""short"" can be. Leaving us wanting more no doubt, is the goal the creators should be shooting for. I don't watch ANY tv anymore, haven't in forever, usually I'm embedded in work, which is a passion. My dinner routine is typically to break out, load up some DUST, oh, Omeletto as well. We'll see if William Osman get's added to that list and? Thank you, once again, great response. I wish I knew the answer because the quality of shorts on this channel is just simply off the hook."
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo," @Jack Williams  DUST has challenging stories, most of which you can't just throw on in the background while playing a videogame.  Most popular youtubers, on the other hand, are popcorn you can easily pay half a mind to and still understand well enough."
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo," @George Dorn  Agreed wholeheartedly. Though we've long discovered the computerfication of society directly followed by those that learned to create ""addicting things"" has shortened the mindspan of well, everyone.I've learned myself over the years by challenging myself in a myriad of ways from reading more challenging things to doing more challenging things that, it's a process. Admittedly as much as I've challenged myself it's significantly shorter than the minds of our time that have went,  quite deep.One learns, over time, tough is good, not bad, doesn't mean I'm dumb to have to contemplate a concept for a day, a week, a month, to dig in and understand it. It just means the concep, in and of itself was challenging enough to require an extended amount of time to grok it."
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo," @Jack Williams  Yes I agree! To answer your question as best I can, I think it is because William's audience is shared with creators like Michael Reeves through collabs, who also have massive followings. It might also be that there is just a broader market for high-octane quick-energy DIY."
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,This was neat.  I remember reading all about Laika like 10 to 15 years ago on one of those days where I had like 15 Wikipedia tabs open because I couldn't stop learning about things.
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,"Oh, the Wikipedia rabbit holes of yore!"
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,As I said my comment it's ironic that I had a book report in 7th grade on the Soviets first cosmonaut pretty cool huh
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,An outstanding cosmic horror pet cemetery short film.
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,So you Laikad it?  Me too.
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,That was a nice one :D very cool special effects <3 keep it going :).
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,What a great and wonderful story. Thx to all.
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,"Love this, hope there is more?"
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,This one was most excellent! 
movies with magical atmosphere recommend,h8ePy1a4Uxo,"I think the ending would have been better if Laika said ""You left me in space !!!"""

Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,interstellar i see in  imax and god this movie is epic
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,5th Element. Surprised it wasnt on the list.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,Blade Runner is considered the best Sci Fi film of all time by scientists.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,2001
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,Battle Beyond the Stars.  Nothing beats a spaceship with bewbs.  Logan's Run a close second.

Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,"Blade Runner, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Day the Earth Stood Still and Forbidden Planet should be on this list."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,Hard to take a list seriously when several great movies are left off and movies that are less than a year old are on the list.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,"The Andromeda Strain is a great movie. Perhaps not fantastical, but I found it really interesting. Perhaps the realism is what made it scary"
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,I have a soft spot for AI: Artificial Intelligence. It's such a strange mix of Spielberg and Kubrick and it's unlike anything I've seen since.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,"""Metropolis"" is one of those tragic film stories.  It's complete, original form has been lost but has been pieced together so that its about 90% due to a Brazilian copy that was discovered a few years ago.  Too bad that film wasn't recognized as a real art form right away so that filmmakers could take better care to preserve their creations."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,"I love scifi and never heard of about four of these. The fact Forbidden Planet, Blade Runner, Logan's Run, Soylent Green, Day The Earth Stood Still didn't just confuses me. I also want to throw in the 1953 version of War of the Worlds since it is the best version of one of the greatest scifi stories of all time."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,"I grew up actually disliking the George Pal War of the Worlds as the only connection to H.G. Wells' source material was the title, how the aliens died, and that they were from Mars..."

Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,The Thing is considered horror. King Kong too if I remember correctly. I don’t get this list.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,Tarkowski's ''Stalker'' deserves to be on the list.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,Why would Metacritic be the best judge?
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,"You forgot ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" original version, ""Things to Come"" original version, ""The Time Machine"" original version, ""Prometheus"" and of course, ""The Thing"" original version."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,You can't have a list of masterpiece Sci-Fi movies without Mars Attacks! in the #1 spot.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,The Black Hole was a damn near perfect Sci-Fi movie!
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,This movie really deserves a remake.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,I remember watching King Kong as a child in the 70s. It was great
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,I saw Metropolis back in the 60's on PBS.  Been a total fan ever since. Seen almost all of the others on the list...
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,"I’ve only watched Star Wars, Mad Max, & Gravity from this list. Probably won’t watch the others. Blade Runner & Interstellar deserve to be on this list."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,I highly reccomend Close encounters of the third kind
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,Predestination with Ethan Hawke should have been on there. Best time-travel movie ever.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,"John Carpenters “The Thing”, Interstellar, Blade Runner, 5th Element, Aliens, Wrath of Khan, Close Encounters, Terminator1 ,Arrival and Galaxy Quest are my top ten. This looper list is a bit lame."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,Interesting that Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein were the only film and sequel to make the list.  Not even Empire Strikes Back managed that after Star Wars.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,"Surprised you didn't include Tarkovsky's ""Stalker."""
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,"""Four sequels""? Karloff was the Creature in Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and Son of Frankenstein; that's two sequels. After Son, the Creature was played by Glenn Strange and even Bela Lugosi (ironic as Lugosi turned down the original version role)."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,"The terminator , T2 Termintor 2 , star wars , star trek first contact , Screamers , species , Alien and predator deserve to be on this list"
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,"STAR WARS didn't dazzle audience with visual effects, it dazzled them with SPECIAL effects, not visual effects, and the fact that Blade Runner is not mentioned on this list means this video is a FAIL for not mentioning one of the most influential sci-fi films of all time, and not knowing the difference between special effects and visual effects."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,"No 'The Thing', no 'Alien', no 'Blade Runner', no '2001 a space odyssey'...You just cannot have scifi without these movies...."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,“The Day The Earth Stood Still” should be at the top of this list!!
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,"Never seen Mad Max, but did beat the enemy u had to kill in a race the quickest ever on the PS3 game, I learned a trick which most ppl don't think of.Never heard of Hard to be a God, Such a beautiful day, Her, Werckmeister, threads!"
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,Many movies have the same title. Please include the (year) with each onscreen title to help viewers find the actual movies you’re discussing.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,"The fact that fury road is the thumbnail says everything we need to know. That movie was awful. Truly, Truly awful"
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,"Metacritic may like Gravity, but scientists don't.  Much of the premise and science surrounding the adventure has been debunked by scientists, physicists, NASA engineers, etc.  It looks and sounds great, most of it being Sandra Bullock breathing heavy and talking to herself.  I even like the movie, despite the criticisms against it.  And after all the trouble she had getting to a spacecraft able to return to Earth, she soft-lands in a lake and nearly drowns when it sinks."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,So 2001 must be on the Perfect Sci-Fi Movie list.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,Great list....thought Arrival would have been there though
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,My top sci fi list Star Wars Back to the future Jurassic parkEscape from La Battlestar galactica Blade runner series The Michael bay transformers The fifth element Judge dredd Total recall Terminator Starship troopers War of the worlds Aliens and predators franchise Men In Black I am Legend Stargate Planet of the apes District 9Demolition man
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,"So many good ones.. Not sure why so many get left behind... Glad to see Wall-E up there.., It was one of the better recent entries. Enemy Mine, Logan's Run, and or the Thing..? To name a few Cerebral decent older entries... Of coarse.., also not many would agree with me in thinking Steven Spielberg's Batteries Not Included is, ( FAR.! ), better than his E.T..., the Last Starfighter, Short Circuit, Inner Space, or how about Lawnmower Man.? I could name many more. If you wanted to fill this list with older slow moving barley existing or difficult to follow plot revealing Sci-Fi Movies where is the first Star Trek Movie.? Aliens, Terminator, or Stargate...? lol. First mistake. Make a list of this kind with only 20 entries."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,"Forbidden Planet. Children of Men. Twelve Monkeys. Annihilation. Ex Machina. Alien/Aliens. Bladerunner/2049. Metropolis (rock soundtrack). Stalker. 2001. This was a seriously flawed list, giving a lot of weight to critics and obscure art house movies."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,NO ALIEN..really.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,"Gravity is not a great film, sci-fi or otherwise. It relies so heavily on  the fiction part that the science part suffers and feels so far-fetched it breaks the suspension of disbelief. It wouldn't be in my top 100 sci-fi films."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,PbCjNsFwMSU,Metropolis is one of my fav movies.

Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,WO8BgKLnY9Q,I think I know why there doin there black screens it’s because if they go too far or show more scenes they could get copyright striked for the vid and this is a reason too if a scene comes up with blood they might have too black it out

Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"I always enjoyed Reb Starling's writing. On the Twirling Zone, as well as his later show, the Note Gallery."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,I love your sarcasm and sharp wit. You earned a thumbs up!  I hope to catch your sarcasm somewhere else on the internet. I bet you could make some awesome protest signs.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,It note gallery any good?
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,Or is it night gallery?
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,The best written tv show ever.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,Lost Age Comics with The Sopranos and The Simpsons (s1-20)
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"The Bronze Age of DC Comics yes this is possibly the best tv show ever written. You could spend hours discussing/debating the morals, themes, real world parallels and messages. Just one episode could serve a class of English students several periods of discussion."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,Always in the top 6 of TV drama’s top 100 list.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,Breaking Bad and the Wire.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,They don’t make em like this anymore
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"Whhhhaaaaaat? What about the guy that writes Walker, Texas Ranger?"
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"Most of TZ's twist endings I'd already absorbed through cultural osmosis long before actually watching the episodes.  Except for 'Five Characters in Search of an Exit', that one actually pleasantly surprised me.  'Midnight Sun' is also fantastic."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"xxsilentreatmentxx The ""Five Characters"" episode is genius."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,GREAT examples...
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"I agree, you should watch ""what you need"" and also ""the mind and tbe matter"""
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,I love the midnight Sun
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"You know reading those episode titles I knew exactly the ones you were talking about and both of those were brilliant indeed xxsilentreatmentxx.  What made them so good is they were sucker punches as you thought they were one thing but in reality they were completely different.  These make for good twists and causes the mind to explode.  I actually loved the Sucker Punch movie from 2011 for that same reason.  A lot of people didn't like it but my family did for the same reasons we loved TZ.  btw, the official title is ""The Midnight Sun""."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,I thought “five characters” was one of the worst along with episode very small space aliens blow up giant balloon Alien to try and fool sheriff and stressed out business woman.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"""Time Enough to Last"" is one of my personal favorites""That's not fair. That's not fair at all. There was time now. There was—was all the time I needed…! It's not fair! It's not fair"""
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,I love that one!
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"""Time enough at last,"" you mean. 1960. Burgess Meredith. Aka Rocky's trainer. There were also 3 others with him."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,I often will bring this episode up since things like this happens often to me but not as bad . My favorite too
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,Futurama did a good parody of it lol
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0, @D  Thanks for Sharing....Gonna check it out...
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,The Pool Game with Jack Klugman!!! Is My Favorite
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,Truedag101 maybe an even better one starring the great Burgess Meredith is “The obsolete man” in my opinion. A real twist at the end-poetic justice.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"Yes, a lesson in storytelling. But you also need to remember the time period it was created in. People who wrote these scripts were avid readers of books. TV was a new medium. The writers weren't constantly bombarded with images from TVs and computers. They actually read books and used their imagination when creating this series."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,Good point.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,Truth.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"Welcome to a world of annalysis, beyond the gates of the first watch of a film, a world that exist in the visuals of the screen and in the sound of the speakers...welcome to the twili....I mean Jack's movie reviews"

Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,Vicente Ortega Rubilar Ii
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,You are a genius.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,Imagine a placeAs it waits to be foundA different dimentionOf mind sight and soundWhere you unlock a doorThrough all space and all timeWhere you hear through deaf earsAnd light shines to the blindA middle ground Between day and nightWhere nothing seems wrongAnd yet nothing seems rightFor reality itselfIs merely a dreamIn this land of shadowsAnd substance and thingsAnd you push past the boundariesAnd borders you findThrough the depths of your fearsAnd the lights of your mindThere's a sign up aheadYou feel lost and aloneBut like so manyYou have just enteredThe Twilight Zone.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"The Obsolete ManChancellor: “You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth, you're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time.”Romney Wordsworth: “I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!”I remember watching this series on repeat since I was a little girl."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,Sir Isaac Newton I guess newton becomes gay. Ok then ?..
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,My favorite too. 
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,Me too
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0, @madmaxz  You must be new to the internet.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0," @Mc_ Zittrer  forgive me, I was like 13 at the time"
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"""Time Enough at Last"", ""A Stop at Willoughby"", and ""The Obsolete Man"" are a few of my favorites"
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"Lorien Waymire Bonus points for citing ""The Obsolete Man""! In the same vein, I've a fondness for ""Deathshead Revisited""."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,Johnathon Haney another great episode!
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,A Stop At W is me after some days at work. Ready to jump off the train while dreaming of escaping.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,A Stop at Willoughby is a favourite of many a down trodden worker. It's definitely my fave.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,A Stop at Willoughby was one of my favorites too.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"When I got older 'Willoughby ' and ' Elegy '  , stories about a nice quiet place to live and a nice quiet place to rest after life were my favorites . But as a kid ' Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up ' and Nightmare At 20,000 Feet were my favorites."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"Oh yes Nightmare at 20,000 feet scared me to death when I was a kid.  It seems funny now but as a kid it was so scary!  I'll have to look up 'Will the Real Martian Please Stand up'.  Will the real Martin Please Stand Up was a great one too with a surprise ending."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,Judgement Night
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"I like A Stop at Willoughby a lot too. I recommend The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine, The Lateness of the Hour, The Passerby, The Midnight Sun, and for those who think that Season 4 episodes were all too long, On Thursday We Leave for Home doesn't feel its length, and the ending is absolutely haunting."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0," @Romeo Alpha  YES, I think Judgement Night and The Hitch-Hiker were the first two I ever watched. Love 'em."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"Picking my favorite episode is tough! Changing of the Guard was a great tear jerker. Howling man, and To Serve Man are up there near the top, as was the episode with the Mardis Gras Masks. What I love most about the Twilight Zone is not so much the cinematics, which are great on their own. No, for me, it is Serling's love of literature, poetry, and humanity which seep through episodes like ""No. 12 Looks just like you."" and ""Obsolete Man"". There just isn't anything out there now that has that unique flavor."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"To serve man, second place, my baby sisters fave episode is the masks."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"Sadly, season 4 of The Twilight Zone is not on Netflix.  This was the season they did hour long episodes instead of half hour.  It was not typically licensed with the others in syndication, so that may have something to do with it.My favorite episode is the other Shatner one:  Nick of Time."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,I am sorry to spread false information. I have a box set and usually just watch from there.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0, @Jack's Movie Reviews  it's fine not everyone knows that
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,Its  maybe on Hulu
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,It's on Netflix now
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0, @BasedMadLad  season 4 isn't though
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,Wasn’t the 4th season recorded on tape as opposed to film?
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"Unfortunately, Season 4 isn't on Netflix, but it is on Hulu as an alternative (at least in the U.S) as well as the rest of the series"
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0," @WhoIsTadhg  I don't think The Twilight Zone had entire seasons recorded on tape, just individual episodes."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,peer study I don’t believe you are correct
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,Season 4 is on Hulu
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"I once won a bet with my dad, He said the name of the Twilight Zone creator was Sterling and I corrected him that it was in fact Serling...no T. I WON!"
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"I love the Twilight Zone! My favorite would probably be ""Will the Real Martian please stand up?""   Great episode."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,I love that one!
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"thats my favorite one, i remember watching it in class"
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,Wow back in high school I remember someone in my class turned in a short story assignment that the teacher was so impressed with that she read it out to the class - it wasn't until seeing this video that I found out they copied it from an episode of the twilight zone! The plot of Occurance at Owl Creek Bridge verbatim except in WW2 or something. I guess that kid cracked the code for winning on shorty story assignments.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"Disgusting! The teacher should have known better -- ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" is an incredibly famous short story by Ambrose Bierce!"
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"The episode""An occurrence at owl Creek bridge"" is a great take on the original short story which I find really good because of the sense of illusion that it creates. This episode translates perfectly all the elements of the original story to a visual medium. Great video as always."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,Thank you!
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"When I was school, this is what we watched instead of reading the actual story. Left a chill in me for the rest of the day."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"the Alfred Hitchcock version is great also...and different (more faithful to the original story, I think)"
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"my favourite episode must be '5 characters in search of an exit' which I think is the peak of twilight zones writing talent and acting. Others would be 'the stranger' which is the first episode I ever saw, 'Night call' which still terrifies me, and 'walking distance'"
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,Rod Serling was brilliant. Superb & iconic show. His impact lives on.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,Rod Serling was a visionary and genius writer.
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"Favorite episodes are hard to pick, but ""A Kind of Stopwatch"", ""The Invaders"", and ""Five Characters in Search of an Exit"" certainly left the biggest impressions on me as a child."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"My favorite episode is Night Call.The increasing, eerie calls a lonely old lady gets and where they came from was so disturbing. And the ending was both heart breaking and terrifying."
Movies that feel like Twilight Zone recommend,YAUWCU5PlO0,"My favorites, in addition to “Eye of the Beholder”, would be “The After Hours”, “In His Image”, “Five Characters in Search of an Exit” and “Mirror Image”."

strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,went to watch the first movie on the list and see its not on netflix. liking how this list is going already lol
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,ok Hush is SO FREAKING GOOD i've seen it 100000 times it always gets me. Insidious is terrifying.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,"Not terrifying whatsoever, wasted an hour and 30 mins on a shit movie"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,Insidious is best
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4, @Ded Tho  which movie is best  horror?
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4, @DZurV_O  creepy i can see but brainwashing? How? I'm genuinely curious
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,Hush is so boring thoTried to watch it but quit half way through
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,I know right hush is soooo good!!!
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,No taste in scary movies at all that movie wasn’t scary at all
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,Netflix hardly has the horror movies that I really wanna watch
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,Can you drop some here
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4, @Nishan Chandan  really liked Voces
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4, @TurtleSquirtle  yea that was actually a decent movie. Horror movies in netflix in general are rubbish tbh
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4, @Nishan Chandan  wrong turn
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,I remember when I first watched Hush. I was home alone and it was like 2 am. My living room is connected to my sun room. My sun room is pure glass windows and even has glass windows looking into the living room. I had to turn my back to it! I felt like someone could be standing out in my dark backyard looking in at me 😆😆
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,movies like this always gets to my head
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,"Am i that poor that i dont know what a ""sun room"" is? Oh boy."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,"I know this sounds crazy but the first time I ever watched Poltergeist I ended up with major paranormal activity that same night. I was woke up 3 separate times by the sound of crunching at the foot of my bed. That day, while I watched the movie, I was chowing down on a big bag of nacho cheese dorritos. Anyway, the third time I heard it I hadn't gone back to sleep completely..I was so scared. I was only 17 at the time. Once I got the courage I RAN to my mom's room! And even tho it was SO scary, I remember being thankful that it had happened. Bc it strengthened my faith. I mean, if you witness evil, you have to believe in the good too!!"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,Is it the original or the remake?
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,Is it the original or the remake?
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,Bro it's a movie whyyyy  are you taking it that far
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,None of these were actually scary
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,The green inferno is a must watch on Netflix
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,Just watched Cam. Surprisingly good suspense flick 👍 Thanks for the recommendation
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,I just finished all 3 of insidious.It’s really good. That’s a movie(s) I recommend! :)
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,There’s also a 4th one :)) insidious the last key it’s my favourite one of all the insidious movies:)
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4, @Chlo♥️  yes it is best
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,"Poltergeist scarred me as a kid.  That clown, Tangina, the steak, that tree!!!  The whole vibe was perfect.  It doesn't hold up as well today.  But if you were a kid in the 80s.....WHEW..."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,Poltergeist is far far better than the new shite on Netflix
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,I just waisted 2 hours of my life watching the worst movie ever! session 9 is terrible and I would not recommend that anybody watch it! So mad 😡
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,Apostle it's a masterpiece!
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,"damn 0:30 i saw the intro and i m like "" ok i found the movie "" then i notice that s just the video intro..."

strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4, @Bekka T  I've been looking for that too
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4, @Anarchist  dang looks good too
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,"Too bad I've already seen ALL of these! Here's some newer recommendations: The Invisible Guest, Platform, The Invitation, As Above So Below, Sinister, Blackcoat's Daughter..."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,the following acts of possession are not for the eyes of the faint hearted
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,That intro is 🔥
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,I enjoy The Ritual and Apostle. I personally didn’t find them scary but not much scares me really. Insidious is alright but only good for jump scares that you see coming a mile off
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,I wanted to watch session 9 but it's not there in Netflix... Damnn... Hard luck I guess...🥺😢
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,damnnnnn the best intro ever made for an youtube video
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,"The killing of the sacred deer is some Hereditary level stuff... just saw it, that’s some stuff that’s now in my head... Great movie"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,Thanks I’m gonna watch Insidious:)
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,1: Green Room2: Session 93: The Ritual4: It Comes at Night5: Insidious6: Hush7: Apostle8: Cam9: The Killing of a Sacred Deer10: Poltergeist
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,I loved hush lol.. I watched it like 10 times
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,The killing of a sacred deer is fuc*ing wild. Never seen anything like it before.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,The autopsy of Jane done really good if your into horror!
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,"Tobe Hooper directed Poltergeist. Not Stephen Spielberg, Spielberg was involved in the production but never directed it"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,Only one of those movies i truly considered scary and that was poltergeists. These days no one makes really gut wrenching scary movies anymore!
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,great video
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,Hush is the best... Available on YouTube also.. Absolutely must watch 👍👍👍
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,"He who has ears to hear, let him hear: John 3:16 says “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” God is good my friends, and He loves you!"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,you missed the doll 1 and 2 but also the third eye 1 and 2
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,✝️Thank you God bless stay safe ✝️
strange movies on Netflix recommend,gAJTZxMMFp4,it comes at night was so underrated
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"Are you brave enough to watch these films? Let us know in the comments.For more Horror, check out our other videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EmCY657OAI&list=PLmZTDWJGfRq2_fzw_GiOxI2UyyurdIHB0"

strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"Midsommar still my no 1Noroi ""the curse"" sits no 2"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,Half way through the list.... Wondering when anything gets scary....
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,No
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,FINALLY someone gives Incident in a Ghostland the recognition it deserves! I can't remember the last time a movie horrified me the way it did!
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"The same director directed the terrifying ""Martyrs"".  I am a horror fan, but this one definitely scared me."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8," @Amanda Wilkinson Tarot  hopefully you mean the original Martyrs and not the terrible remake lol. The original is one of those films that's so good and so perfectly shot, that when the credits roll you're sitting there completely stunned at what you just watched but you can't wait to tell someone else about it."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,@Zachary Scott  Yes.  I believe it was the original.  I actually haven't worked up the nerve to watch it yet.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8," @Amanda Wilkinson Tarot  the original with subtitles is available to rent/buy on the VUDU app right now, but how long it stays that way I'm not sure. That's the only place I've seen it available unless it's some sketchy place online. Definitely worth checking out if that kind of horror is what you like. Might want to have like the Wizard of Oz or something cheerful set to go for after haha"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"It's a great movie & I know almost no one who's seen it which is a shame. Personally, I would have had it higher up the list as for me, it was better than It Follows & The Conjuring. Found both of those overrated."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8, @Amanda Wilkinson Tarot  both are free on Tubi right now.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"Yeah it had almost like those dark tv series vibe in how detailed it got into the psyche of their captor AND victims, and never ending twists! Honestly terrifying."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"Yeah that movie is very good. Chilling when you realize whats up(those who know, know)"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,The ritual made me respect Netflix original horror films
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,is the ritual movie good?
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,It should be at no. 1
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8, @꧁☬Faruk☬꧂  yes
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,Then fear street turned me off again
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8, @guitardude 777  OK I will watch it. Thank you!
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8, @꧁☬Faruk☬꧂  I think you'll like it
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8, @guitardude 777  okkkk
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8, @꧁☬Faruk☬꧂  I mean it depends what you’re into but I would recommend it to everyone
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8, @Chris22  yeah I didn’t like that shit either
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,Loved that movie and for me anyways had some truly shocking moments
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,Ok. The editor that put that “My House” quote from Conjuring 2 just before announcing the #2 pick of His House is a fucking genius and needs a raise…
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,Lol came to the comments to see who else noticed
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8, @Jerry Prado  because it was super subtle...
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8, @Jordan Smith  Thank you Jordan I can do without the sarcasm
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8, @Jerry Prado  loll
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,I thought that too hah!
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,“His house” ranking so high on the list makes me so happy bc the scares are proper and it’s such a captivating take on the heaviness of guilt.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,wow someone who got the movie!! yes so sad what they went through! I have a friend who works with refugees and that movie more accurate than most people realize!
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,Screw guilt.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8, @Dion St. Michael  it’s dumb feeling. Not worth the weight.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"Ghost man: “My house!”Miss Mojo: “Number 2, His House” I see you, editors hahahahaha"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"LMAO, glad I wasn't the only one that chuckled at that! XD"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,It was so funny. 
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"The Creep movies are really really effective. They have a suspense that builds and builds and builds...and a main villain that is unsettling and kind of realistic. Props to achieving a memorable, scary movie on what was obviously a non-existent budget."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,The end of the first creep is shocking. Your exactly right
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"Fear street part 2 is is my favourite horror movie on Netflix. It's like a modern  retelling of Friday the 13th but with less horny teens, more gore and a better story. Absolutely loved all 3 but part 2 is something special. His House a close second"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,I have to look at it now.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8," @Tr Vlogs  Yeah check out the trilogy, they're excellent"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8, @Ethanol3310  Thank you.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"Nothing like the Fear Street books by R L Stine, of which these movies were supposed to be inspired by. The guy that wrote Goosebumps wrote an older, teenage based audience book series called Fear Street. However, like the Goosebumps tv show, the three part Netflix tri-fecta, did not live up to the context."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8, @Ethanol3310  they’re not
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8, @TyTrips  everyone is entitled to their own opinions
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,Do i need to watch 1 to get two or can it stand on its own? Trilogy movie is kind of big commitment lol
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8, @Alicia Dinar  they're all connected
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8," @Alicia Dinar  you need to watch all 3, and in the right order"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,I don't know about this i really hated this movie like really
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"The perfection is a legitimate masterpiece, the twists and darkness of the story are very well executed. Glad it made the list !"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"Crimson Peak is one of my favorites and usually I'm not that much into ""horror"". It really seems to pay homage to gothic romantic horror past like a subtle honorary reference to Peter Cushing by giving Edith his last name, Jane Eyre (particularly Mr. Rochester, who Thomas paraphrases when he ""proclaims"" his love for Edith), Dragonwyck and Edgar Allen Poe especially House of Usher. In fact, you almost hope/expect to see Vincent Price's image and/or ghost on the stairs or out of the corner of your eye."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"That's exactly why I loved it. I took gothic literature during my uni days & that's what it reminded me of. All those gothic romance, haunted house stories."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,I didn't like the dog getting killed.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8, @Theresa Teske  neither did I.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"""Sinister"" hasn't made the list? Maybe it's not available on US Netflix but it is available on UK Netflix. It is a masterfully crafted movie that is proper chilling and terrifying at parts. The sound design and lighting is incredible as we feel every emotion that Ethan Hawke's character feels throughout the movie. If anyone hasn't seen it, watch it"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,Those films of the families..... 
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,Sinister still gives me chills to this day.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,Sinister is absolutely phenomenal. The lawnmower scene scares me everytime
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,I think about that movie a lot. It’s so good. Love Ethan Hawke.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"Really enjoyed ""The Ritual"". Cliche name but the story is different. Worth it."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,I saw that one. That Norse Mythological Beast that has its own cult?
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8, @Blake Devitt  Yup 
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,Its honestly one of the scariest movies I've seen in a long time too..
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"The Ritual is my all-time favourite Horror movie. When I watched it on release, I hadn't been scared, LEGIT scared, by a horror movie since the age of 12. The Ritual still infuses my nightmares, mostly consisting of the amazing sounds. It's so prevalent in each nightmare I have that I can consciously think to myself ""Oh, there it is!"" mid-dream!!"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,I like a double feature of The Descent and The Ritual as cautionary tales about staying on the beated path. Adam Nevell needs more of his work adapted.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"Crimson Peak is not scary it was tragic, love story which contained elements of horror."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,It was the literal act of false advertising 
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,Its still pretty great.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"I wish 1922 was in this list, was honestly a horrifying movie on Netflix. I like how that one really brought horror to people as a punishment, I’m not hating on this list, but this one was a good one"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,Thomas Jane did an extraordinary job with 1922. He used an old accent and changed his appearance enough to make us forget what actor played the infamous main character. 1922 is a great ghost movie.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"omg dude worst movie ever! lol and i read the book first as well. Arguably one of Stephens worst short stories, and I really can't fault anything Stephen's written. It is painstakingly slow, and the big finale? Like the last bit of air escaping a balloon."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8, @Alicia Dinar  I thought it was great
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,I liked the movie
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,I originally watched “hush” on Netflix years ago. I revisit it at least once a year. One of my all time favorite movies ️
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"Just watched it last night for the 2nd time, lol good flick"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"Gotta say that ""It Follows"" did nothing for me.  I just don't understand its popularity.  However, ""The Ritual"" deeply scarred me.  One of the scariest movies I've ever seen.  The scene in the house where the guy woke up praying to that statue thing literally made me jump in my seat.  What kind of warped mind thinks this stuff up?"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"It did something for me,  it made me laugh out loud  because of how ridiculous  it is."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,Agreed. It was awful
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"Geralds Game, It Follows and The Exorcist definitely take the cake for me."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,You had me with the exorcist
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,You had me with it follows
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,You had me at freaking Gerald's game. Seriously a sleeper gem from the mind of Stephen King
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"Why does everybody like that movie ""Geralds Game"" it was so boring... I'm more into horror movies and for me this movie is not horror at all."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8, @Bianca Andreea  I agree
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,It follows cinematography & soundtrack is incredible
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,I prefer pie. Raspberry is my favorite.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8," @Jonathan D'Haiti  I thought it was pretty good considering most of the story revolves around one character in a single location if I remember correctly. I was pleasantly surprised it held my interest,"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8, @Dion St. Michael  mine too
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,Gerald’s Game is amazing. One of my favorite horror movies that I unfortunately always forget about.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,Aaahhhh... Haunting of Hill House.. every time I hear that name I smile. I still to this day swear to friends and family it's one of the best shows I've ever seen. And I'm not a horror junkie. So I'll have to check out Gerald's GameHush and Ritual are pretty good though.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"Gerald's game was hard to watch, but a genius movie."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"I absolutely loved the fear street movies, thought all 3 were great, especially as a childhood fan of the books... but I don't honestly think they were ""scary"".. they were fun as hell but certainly not scarier than hostel or apostle.. mostly the rest of the list got it right, but my biggest beef with this,  just like every other watchmojo list is that you guys can't seem to get over your boner for the original exorcist movie. I get it, it was iconic for its' time.. but it just doesn't hold up and it does not scare me in the slightest. Not even a nod to green Inferno or As Above, so Below? shame."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,HUSH is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. 3 times so far and it's thrilling EVERY SINGLE TIME.*ps: I've watched for the 2nd time with my mom - as she doesn't speak English and I know she would be able to enjoy it!
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,I absolutely loved the Creep movies and The Ritual. These are 3 movies that any horror fan should check out...
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,its mindblowing that no movie could  top the exorcist till this date
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"I loved ""Crimson Peak""! But, ghost stories are my jam."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"""THE GIRL NEXT DOOR"" is literally the most disturbing movie I've ever watched. I can normally sleep fine after horror movies. I can even sleep while they are on. That movie? I actually had to watch something happy after. And STILL had issues sleeping."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"I’ve seen just about all of these, pretty solid list. I love the mind games/horror genre. Guys give me more movie recommendations."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"I saw The Exorcist for the first time when I was 17. Alone in the house. At night. It's a creepy and beatifully done movie, but I think time took it's toll on it. Still, one of the best things is that bad cgi wasn't available."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,The Fear Street trilogy was awesome
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,I have seen all of them I love horror movies. I can not say I was scared but highly Intrigued and entertained by the movies.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,You gotta give it to Netflix the fear street Trilogy was amazing 
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,I agree with this list for the most part. Especially the top four.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,So many good ones on this list. I’ve seen most of them but there are a few to add to my watch list.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,I personally think that REC should have been on the list
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,Both creeps were amazing ! I wish mark will do a 3rd but it's not likely going to happen  since the second one almost didn't happen
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,The scares in His House really worked for me. Catching little things in the background. There’s one scene with Wunmi (main woman) on the couch + home alone — creepy af.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,"Hostel is by far the scariest... it's so terrifying because some poor souls on this planet, really have and still do, endure that level of excruciating, unbearable, torture. What money won't buy is the darkest side of humanity."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,Incident in a ghostland is such an amazing and underrated movie with such an amazing twist at the end.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,1r3wWHrDfg8,I'm suprised at how mostly good this list is.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,What do you think are some of the most underrated things on Netflix?
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,atypical
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,I don't know.  I got HBO Max recently and don't want Netflix too.Saw Justice League.  Want to see King Kong vs Godzilla and may not resubscribe after that.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Dark
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Yes best show of the last 5 years. Dark s1 and 2 are masterpieces
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"Tau, Annihilation, Dark, Alice in Borderland"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,I just finished Alice in Borderland. Phenomenal!
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,The Night Comes For Us!!!!
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Dark
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"If Train to Busan is still on Netflix, watch it!"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so, @yuutsu  Annihilation made me cry.  I'm pretty sure the director never even read the book.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"Elizabeth Harvest was a very interesting movie.   A babysitter's guide to monster hunting was lots of fun to watch.I really liked The 12th Man.  Wait,   It was the ""The 13th Warrior"" that I really liked.  One thing I liked about it was that ultimately two cultures found respect for each other.   Yeah,  most people probably didn't think of that."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"More people need to see 6 Underground. Easily the best action movie they've put out, not Extraction. The action is real, practical, crazy stuff. Ryan Reynolds is brilliant and the story and themes are great, especially given the politcal landscape in 2020. So underrated."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"I saw it, the director went overboard with the camera cutting and editing, it was hard to watch and gave me a headache, tho the final action scene with the magnets was pretty insane and refreshing to watch. I guess teenagers will love it and not notice the over editing cuts"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so, @luvyou baby  it’s a Michael Bay movie.  Gotta take your motion sickness pills before you watch!
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"I've seen it, wasn't that great."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,I disagree. Lame movie.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Seriously? What about Extraction? That was way better and more grittier.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,6 unground was meh. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you're really bored and have a lot of free time.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"the progression of events is weird, got lost honestly..."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Dude extraction was way better
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Extraction and Old Guard are the best Netfix originals BY FAR!!!
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,I liked 6 Underground it was a good action movie but overall Extraction in my opinion is a better movie.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,I loved Elizabeth Harvest. It was like a very long black mirror episode. Very good movie.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"Elizabeth Harvest was wonderful! A beautiful, modern, Twilight Zone/Black Mirror, re-telling of the Blue Beard fable. Gorgeous, rich and twisted"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"I watched A Monster Calls a few years ago. It truly was heartbreaking, so much so I still think about it having lost my own parent younger."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,1. Nocturnal Animals2. Braven3. A Monster Calls4. Circle 5. Elizabeth Harvest6. The Outpost 7. Knock Knock8. Operation Finale9. Vampire vs The Bronx10. A Babysitter’s Guide ...11. The 12th Man12. Little Evil
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,I watched Circle and the whole film is basically just them standing there in a circle. It was pretty creepy but it is more psychological than action
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"Knock knock started out interesting and then just got hilariously bad.  I'm convinced it was made just so Keannu could get to say B!tch over and over again, LOL. Definitely worth watching for the sheer hilarity of it."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,i always regret not doing things i didnt know existed.

strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so," @The Court Of Public Opinion   For real! I only saw the first episode and though ""What the hell?!"""
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Sometimes underrated films you watch on netflix is a gem much better on commercial ones.

strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Yeah mate so accurate
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,😂😂😂😂👍
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,I know! What the hell is up with that? There's got to be some psychological thing going on.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,It would be better for viewers if they kept the old ratings system to get an idea of what might be a good film. But they want us confused and disoriented from avoiding the huge catalogue of crap they have.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,😭
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Seeking is more addictive than liking something
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"Elizabeth Harvest is one of my favorites, if you haven’t seen it give it a try."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,I’ve seen Braven and can confirm that it’s a really good movie
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,I'm a big Mamoa fan but my opinion Braven wasn't his best if you want to experience how awesome Mamoa is watch that show called See it's insane !!
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"I would have had to have watched something to know whether I would have regretted not watching it. But since I would have watched it, I could then only regret having watched it, instead of regretting not having watched it, because I would have watched it. If I could then unwatch it, I might regret it, but then I wouldn't know why I was regretting something that I hadn't watched."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,You should become a writer for a politician.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Yeah yeah true!
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Bronx VS Vampires was funny and cool.  We watched it as a family and my kids were not too scared.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"In Braven, he didn't take his daughter up to the cabin. She snuck into the car without him knowing she was with the entire time. She left a note behind, letting her mom know that she went with her dad and grandad to the cabin."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,I watched Elizabeth Harvest twice it's so good.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"Funny you'd call Elizabeth Harvest a fairy tale, because it sounds like the plot of ""Bluebeard,"" a classic 17th century french fairy tale.It's interesting that this is the first time it's ever been adapted for screen. It's so classic, there should be a Disney version."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,That's exactly what I thought from the description!!!
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,I just go on Netflix to spend an hour scrolling through all the content that is useless to me.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Yea and after all that dont end up watching anything really
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,yeah and after that i bet you end up watching youtube lol

strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,The Outpost (Great)
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Knock Knock was CHeezy but alright. ONly watched because of the hot chicks
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Elizabeth Harvest really good. I watched it a year ago
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,*Nocturnal Animals (excellent)

strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,I just saw The Outpost.  Excellent suggestion.  Thank you for the recommendation!
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Archive 81 was an awesome series on Netflix and deadly class need to make season 2 and 3
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Nocturnal animals was good 👍 the ending was cool too.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"Just searched for Knock Knock.. A Monster Calls, The Outpost and Elizabeth Harvest.. None of which are on Netflix UK 🤔😔"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,None are on Australian Netflix!!
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"That's messed up, if Netflix shows a movie trailer it should be for any and all countries! We should start a petition for that."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Outpost was on Netflix on April 21
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"Yeah that really gets to me when you hear about something but its not on your Netflix  or signing up for à certains séries. Only to find out à month later  they are not streaming il no more,makes me angry."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,None of are on Netflix India
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Great picks!  Thanks so much for shining a light on them.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"Eli Roth may have a rep w (what?) millennials or whatever demographic but over the top is the baseline for the antics of his generational tortuous & exploitive humor. Seen Green Inferno & Knock Knock and its all cheap sadistic thrills w big gaping holes. Keanu maybe took this role to play counter to his good guy persona but he IS SO GOOD a persona that its hard to take the unlikely outcome. Even a good decent person would take defensive matters into their hands & not be a pawn or toy to someone else's behaviors. He didn't have to act, so I don't think he was acting, its just a message, a bad mixed message. Roth's morality tale is scarey I guess because there are many douche bags in his universe. BRAVEN on the other hand is good, satisfying in countering the violence heaped upon his family but these people react in survival mode that Roth's character can't seem to find the wherewithal to react to the danger toward his family. OUTPOST has good reviews from those who were there, and how the brass basically left them out to dry & die in an impossible logistical situation."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"Having great actors on a film makes you think it something worth watching. Elizabeth Harvest, seem interesting."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,I definitely love A Monster Calls! 🤗
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Gonna watch it just lost my dad recently and it looks good feel like it’s gonna make me cry
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,A monster calls should come with a warning label. WARNING:  the final 15 minutes of this film will leave you crying inconsolably.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Circle is the scariest film I have seen along with Grave Encounters.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,I'm about to watch this. You better be right
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Damn really??
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Circle was so bad
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,It was not scary at all. Kind of interesting though. I give it a 7/10 for the netflix scale
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Didn't see on there
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,I'm surprised there isn't more buzz about The Coldest Game. It's great!
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Level 16 was interesting Longmire Snowpiercer Outlander Shameless
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Can’t regret a movie I haven’t watched or heard of🤭
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"I would strongly advise against watching circle. What I'm about to say will be contradictory and will make you think, that doesn't make sense. I don't know how else to describe it so I'll just say it and let you decide. Circle is a good movie that will leave you feeling like you wasted your time. Do yourself a favor watch the first and last 10 minutes and that basically sums up the movie."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"Circle was good, I'm waiting for part 2"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"Little Evil must not have been very good, because I know I've watched it yet I don't remember a thing."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"""Omen by way of Shawn of the Dead"" Perfect description."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Circles is a must watch!!!
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Nocturnal Animals is incredible
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,It appears Braven is no longer available on US Netflix.EDIT: Turns out most of these are no longer available on US Netflix.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Vampires vs The Bronx is awesome!!! Recommend!!
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Vampires vs the Bronx is the American equivalent of Boyega's Fight the Block.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Kneue Reeves literally ruins a slightly above average film in Knock Knock. I seriously can’t believe how horrible his acting is in this movie.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,Elizabeth Harvest sounds like the tale of Blue Beard.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"Sense 8 is great, I hated finding out it was canceled"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"""The Babysitter's Guide to Hunting Monsters"" sounds like ""Labyrinth""."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"If I haven't seen them, how can I regret not watching them?"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,"Good thing I cancelled NF some time ago...even more pleased now that the ""celebs"" are all cheering about the ""trial"" result"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,When practically all of the mentioned movies are not available on Netflix in your country........
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,How can you regret not watching something? You wouldn't even know what you're regretting.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4G2PisM1-so,How TF was Keanu Reeves unlikable in KNOCK KNOCK??? He was 100% the victim.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,What other strange and unusually awesome Netflix movies should've made this list?

strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,The Human Centipede Trilogy. Whoever came up with that concept was on some serious hallucinogens.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,Kung Fury. Inifini.He Never Died is amazing.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,I loved He Never Died
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,Yesss. Loved He Never Died.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,Nymphomaniacs
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"GuyverU01 so did I, watched it several times"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"Parasite is a strange movie. Demi Moore's first film. (No, she's not the parasite. LOL)"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"just wanna say night/day watch is srsly one of the best supernatural/sci-fi movies ever made. beats underworld by a mile, with awesome cinematography and it even has specially made english subs that work with the visuals. it's a stunning treat, definitely worth a watch."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"Back in the day, so for me I'm referring to 2008-2011, Netflix had honestly the best B-rated horror movies possible! My friends and I would stay over at someone's house spending the whole night watching every single horror movie available.Thankskilling is hands down an instant classic. It's our centuries version of Goblins 2.Filthy McNasty was truly filmed in some dudes apartment with a handheld camera and somehow made it on Netflix. It's on YouTube, I believe, so check it out and try to figure out how it made it on to Netflix.Rabid Grannies, MonsTurd, Return to Camp Sleepaway(all of them), I Scream You Scream We All Scream for Ice Cream, Silent Night/Deadly Night, and just so many more. They truly had every amazing P.O.S. horror movie from the 80's and 90's up.Come on Netflix, go back to your roots!!!"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"""John Dies at the end"" is one of the best bizarre movies on Netflix, not sure why it didn't make this list while some of the others weren't bizarre, just bad."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,Amazing movie!!
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,Great books too
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,yes.. old and free for many years
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"The Scribbler was awesome. Amazing casting, effects, story, action/comedy...it will affect every emotion. I loved it! I had to buy it. It is definitely something you'd want to watch over and over, like 1 time a year, like a holiday!"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"I would urge you to watch ""Humanoids from the Deep."" It was also released with the imaginative title ""Monsters.""It has Doug McLure in the lead. It involves the fishermen of what looks like British Columbia and girls in skimpy swimwear being eaten by mutated salmon. It probably better if you just watch it."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"If you haven't seen it, Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart is an amazing movie. Bizarre, yet oddly charming. Wonderful animation, music, and uses a ton of visual metaphors, which I dig. It plays like a modern-day fairy tale."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"Night Watch, Day Watch is actually a trilogy of books. They are very intelligently written and fantastic. I loved the movie!!!"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,You are absolutely right. I'm still waiting for part 3 to make it to the U.S. (unless it's here and I don't know).
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,Dusk Watch will not be made.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,They renamed it Twilight Watch but it hasn't gone into production yet they will probably go back to Dusk Watch due to those awful Twilight movies.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,Carole S. So is there a third flic?
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,I think that there are 4 books not just three
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,Me too.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ," @GBZOholika81  There are 6 books in the series by Sergei Lukyanenko, all translated to English with the most recent released in the Fall of 2016"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"I actually saw Deathgasm last week. Crazy, but good. I also recommend Beyond The Gates, the story of two brothers who try to save their fathers soul from a video board game that's actually a pathway to the underworld."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"I really liked Day Watch/Night Watch. I wasn't sure what to expect going into the first one but by the end I was a fan, and that's having not read the books. It's a shame the third never got made."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"I've seen one or two of these including ""Zombbeavers"", and, mostly, glad I did.""ABCs of Death"" was very, very uneven though."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"I enjoyed Nightwatch/Daywatch very much,  and Deathgasm should be watched at least once"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"I bought Nightwatch and Daywatch on DVD when it first got released years ago, no regrets."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,I've been looking for nightwatch for years without success! I saw it when it came out and was never able to find it again - but was sure it was the movie I was looking for right as it showed up. Thanks for that!
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,The Nightwatch/Daywatch movies are based on books of the same names. They explain the whole mythology. Very much worth the read.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"He Never Died was great! I really wanted a continuation, a TV series, something. Henry Rollins is so cool!"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"Nightwatch and Daywatch are totally excellent movies, didn't know what the hell was going on at first but they were so good i watched em again and sussed them out.LOTR Vs Blade Runner and errr, something else"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"I saw Nightwatch & Daywatch from Blockbuster videos back in the day. Thought that it was supposed to be a trilogy, but a 3rd film never came. Interesting style & universe created. Definitely could tell the director was going places."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"dafttool They are based on a trilogy of books (that have been translated into English). Day Watch strays heavily from the source material though. The story in the movies was finished off, though, so a third movie wasn't really needed."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"Andrei Vassiliev That's a difference between Russia & Hollywood. If a book series is a trilogy, they stretch out it into 4 movies. Or like The Hobbit film, a short story expanded out to 3 long movies. It's all about the money; the creative integrity be damned"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"Ive actually watched a few of these, and they weren’t ALL bad,Dameonium- wasn’t that great, but interesting.Night watch Day - watch was hard to follow. It’s often hard to watch subtitled films, but this is harder, because the story and characters are all over the place, and they don’t explain it at all. I never made it to the end.The ABCs of death, I haven’t seen, in fact it isn’t on Netflix right now, at least not in Canada, but I have seen the sequel ABC’s of death 2- and it’s definitely different! Not a ton of scares, but when there is, its really good! The stories and the various ways they are presented, is very interesting though and it’s worth checking out, in my opinion at least!He Never Died- I actually liked quite a bit!the Scribbler- I saw it a loong time ago, way before Netflix, and if I am remembering correctly it wasn’t that bad! It was a tad confusing, but entertaining enough!"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"He never dead is awesome, I saw it a few years ago completely by accident and was very impressed."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"Thank you for the great suggestions. I just went through all of these on my subscription to Netflix and found, at least for me, that God of Cookery, and 3 Headed Shark Attack are not available. Hard to be a God - dvd only, and also Upstream Color - dvd only"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"I've seen Night Watch and Daywatch. I understand it was originally supposed to be a trilogy based on the popular Russian books. That's probably why Daywatch feels disjointed by comparison to Nightwatch. Maybe they tried to cram too much in.As for the rest I need to check out Wetlands God of Cookery (I'm pretty sure it's the same guy who did Shaolin Soccer), The ABCs of Death, He Never Died, Daemonium, The Scribbler, Deathgasm, and Zombeavers."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"I don't know if it's still on there but ""Lo"", a dark lovestory. Very well made."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,There was also a movie called Boy Eats Girl that used to be on there. I enjoyed that as well.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"I watched the abc's of death with a friend one night, and he and i both agree that it was the most bizarre movie we've seen."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"Very good list, I liked everything on it I already saw and look forward to watching the rest."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,NIGHTWATCH/DAYWATCH ARE FANTASTIC! 💜 I've owned those films for the longest and watched them countless times. Definitely worth a look!
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,He Never Died quickly became one of my favorite movies.  I highly recommend it.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"Upstream Color is really good. If Primer is still on there I think it's by the same guy, but either way it's great.The Scribbler was a comic book. Pretty good movie, and the actress is also in Arrow. She's much better in this, and there's brief nudity."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"ABC's of Death is the absolute perfect movie for those who, while under the influence of booze or whatever you prefer, love to laugh at cheesy horror. Also, if you're a guy and or watch it with a bunch of guys, there's one sketch in particular that will actually freak you the fuck out! It made me cry from laughing so hard and legitimately fucked me up for about a week with one of their sketches, so amazing in my book!!!"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,deathgasm is actually freaking amazing. I put it on as a joke and ended up enjoying the hell out of it. Its really damn good
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,Night and day watch really isn't that bad at all.. I watched the second not knowing about the first but I still actually liked it quit a bit. There is one or two parts I didn't really get but it doesn't hurt the show at all
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"I've already watched ALL OF THESE!!! Loved most of them, too."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"I loved ""He Never Died."" I had it 5* until Netflix took away the star system..."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,Nothing on Netflix will substitute Wishmaster 2 in my heart.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,Deathgasm is freaken fantastic!!! I am actually going to by the movie...Super gory and fun.
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"I saw zombeavers a few years ago, it was pretty decent!"
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"""After"" was pretty good.   There's a movie called ""come back to me""   It looks cheap but I fucking loved it, I can't say anything without ruining it, it's a bit long but it's very worth it.The wailing, eyes of my mother, the tiger, jinn ( the one w the mother and daughter). All those movies are fucking perfect but international."
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,He Never Died has always been one of my favourite films. A very under rated gem
strange movies on Netflix recommend,4PCmbdek3pQ,"I don't know about Zombeavers. Although the premise sounds outrageous, it's actually pretty much exactly what you'd expect--meaning it isn't the weirdest movie on this list."

movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,Of course  Denzel Washington in Training Day... also loved him in American Gangster and Remember the Titans.  I also loved Joaquin Phoenix as Joker
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"To me, I can't think of a bad performance from Denzel Washington. The script would be sub-par and he would still give it his all. That's why he's one of my favorite actors of all time."
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,I think that's what separates a good actor from a great actor. The ability to have a less than stellar script and still commit and absolutely chew it up takes some next level dedication

movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U," @Everdeep Naga II  don’t count, u gotta do what you gotta do in those times of a struggling actor 😂  movie was Horrendous"

movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U, @Nikolas Mokalis  Really can agree with this one. I think the plot of the movie was pretty meh tbh. But damn Denzel's acting is just as phenomenal as usual.

movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U, @Nerdstalgic  He deserved an Oscar for Malcolm X
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"Wow. I literally just got done rewatching Training Day a few nights ago, and this hands down one of the greatest performance in cinematic history and Denzel's career best. Not only is this film tightly written, but Alonzo Harris is THE perfect villain as he is an example of what happens when a man is corrupted by the system via power and greed, or maybe that he was already that way and the system in place brought out more evil and sadistic ways within him. Love how steadfast in his beliefs Alonzo is, despite the fact that he's indeed evil."
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"""You either die a hero. Or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain."""
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,In Alonso's case he decided to go that way as with most others. There is a deleted scene in another version of the movie showing the day that made him choose to either play by those rules or go against the system and he cowardly chose to be molded by it
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"If you loved that movie then you'll like the video The Vile Eye made, ""Analyzing Evil: Alonzo Harris"""
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U, @Faraamah White  Seen it a ton of times. His videos are immaculate
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,FYI The scene where Alonzo is surrounded by the block and does his King Kong monologue was all ad lib. None of that was in the script. The moment he picked up his cigarettes it was all him.
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U, @Jon Plaud  that's fucking fantastic; never knew that
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,Denzel has had much better performances in my opinion.

movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,Check out Man On Fire. My personal favorite from Denzel.
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,The script is actually pretty bad it wasn't well written at all. Denzel just made it what it is. Every other actor in this film is easily forgettable
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,Denzel is a once in a generation actor. Any role he plays wether  it in a good movie or bad is still iconic for having him play them
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,I just watched this movie. I'm still speechless

movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U, @Brandon Hoover  autocorrects a bitch. Thanks for the catch my guy
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,the PCP scene is less bout intimidation and more about calculated villainy. it was for the sole purpose of being able to put Hoyt in a no-win position when Roger is killed. he took Hoyt's confessing power away with all of the narcotics in his system.
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"When I first watched it, my thoughts were ""this drug scene is definitely about Alonzo being able to have something on Hoyt later."""
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,Yep
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"Yup. I don't know what the YouTuber was going on about. Alonzo just wanted leverage on Hoyt because he knows he was gonna go do something extremely illegal. Just in case Hoyt cannot be corrupted or bought, he can keep Hoyt from going to confess straight away."
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,YES!!! I was about to comment about that.
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U," @Bern  That was definitely the aim, but his reaction while doing it adds depth to the deed. It's what separates an action from just being an action but adding thought process behind it. I'm not saying this to be pretentious or anything, because you're right. But imagine if Alonso had just sat, stone-faced while taking Hoyt through that process. It would reach the same end, but wouldn't be nearly as entertaining or informative of WHO Alonso is."
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"Yes! Thank you! Also, maybe I missed it, but did he mention in this video that Alonzo owes money to Russians? Because I think that was the motivation why he did what he did in order to get that money and survive… In addition to that, the movie plot is only one day long which I think is brilliant!"
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"6:43 He isnt just getting off on the power, he actually is testing him. He’s seeing if Hoyt can be easily manipulated by Alonzo. If he can then he can use him on his crew. If not then Hoyt can still be used but will just be disposed of when his usefulness runs out. Which is exactly what he tried to do by getting the gangsters to kill him."
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"Damn I never made the connection with the scene where he leaves Hoyt at the gangsters house. Never occurred to me he was trying to get rid of him, I thought it was another score just like they took that woman’s money and got shot at earlier in the movie. To me he was tryna get all the money to pay his debt"
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"You missed the point of this scene as well.1. It wasn't that he was trying to see if Hoyt could be easily manipulated. He was seeing if he was dirty, just like everyone else on Alonzo's crew. He's basically telling Hoyt, ""Dude, we're all corrupt here; are you?"" Now if Hoyt decides to report Alonzo as a dirty cop, then...2. Alonzo can say, ""Who's word are you going to accept? A decorated officer like myself? Or a rookie with drugs in his system?"" He was ensuring that if Hoyt tried to turn on him, Alonzo always had an alibi. If you remember, at one point Hoyt realizes this and says, ""You've been setting me up all day!"", to which Alonzo responds, ""I'VE BEEN SETTING YOU UP ALL WEEK!!!""And yes, once he realized that Hoyt was incorruptible, he tried getting rid of him by dropping him off at the latin gang's house. Ironically, Hoyt saving that girl from being raped actually saved his life later on."
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U," @DontBanMeBroDontBanMe!  Wrong. It was obvious from their first encounter that Hoyt wasn’t dirty. Alonzo isn’t stupid. He knew Hoyt was a straight cop. Cops usually don’t start off dirty, they get corrupted over time. It’s heavily implied that Alonzo corrupted his other crew members and he himself was corrupted by the Three Wise Men. Hoyt resisted the corruption and pushed back against every dirty thing Alonzo did, which is why he couldn’t trust Hoyt and tried to get rid of him.And he only got the marijuana laced with PCP from the college kids in a random occurrence. Just because a character says they planned something all week doesn’t make it true. Keep in mind Alonzo’s ultimate goal that day was to get enough money for the Russians. His plan with Hoyt was to manipulate and corrupt him to achieve that goal. First it was the drugs and police brutality, then it was going along with felony murder, evidence tampering and theft. You got to start small before you go big. If Alonzo wasnt forced to corrupt Hoyt in 24 hours and instead had months to do it he could have succeeded."
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"I’m really happy that more people are recognising Denzel’s amazing performance and not considering his Oscar win an “upset” ... I know at the time Russell Crowe was the favourite to win for A Beautiful Mind, but with enough time passed, it really shows which performance has had a longer lasting impression and why."
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,I mean Russell won it for one my favorite movies gladiator a year earlier so Denzel deserved it just for his performance alone
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,Do you think he deserved it for 'glory'?
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U, @Stephen Grigg  I think so. He has a subtle but powerful character arc. I still get chills when he shouts “COME ON” to the troops during the final battle.
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"Not to mention how many thought it was shitty that Denzel won for playing that character. Like ""black man being a criminal"" situation. Those that think/thought that truly missed the depth of the character and how different it was from his usual character choices"
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,Denzel should have won for Hurricane too

movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U," @Stephen Pena  No, they didn't."
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"Wow, incredible analysis! Not a lot of people are talking about this film these days, yet it remains one of the most captivating crime thrillers of all time. And Denzel's performance of such an intricate character is just perfect, one of the best ever, which is why Alonzo Harris makes my list of the top villains of all time. 👏"
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,People talk about this film ALL the timeStop trying to lie for likes
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"This entire analysis is wrong. Alonzo was doing literally everything, the entire movie, to save his life. All the sht with making hoyt do the drugs, was just an insurance policy so hoyt wouldn't turn him in."
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"Ethan Hawke also played the confusion and the ""trying to hide his fear and discomfort"" so well."
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,You gotta control your smiles and cries because that’s all you have.
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"I have a lot of feelings about Denzel Washington's wins only being for playing gangsters, and slaves and agree with some of his comments around those wins and the chances for African-American to really win awards in other roles. By far, his superior performance was in Malcolm X, and I'm glad they nominated him, but I feel he should have won that year. Scent Of A Woman is a good film, and Al Pacino should have been nominated, but I feel Denzel's performance was far superior. I hope you consider doing a review of that transformative role playing the civil rights leaders."
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,He absolutely should have won for Malcolm.  Such an amazing performance!
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"They gave Al Pacino that oscar as a legacy thing like Leo got for Revenant even thought they didnt truly give the best performances that year. Denzel shouldve won for Malcom X but RDJ gave a great performance as Charlie Chaplin although the movie feels too ""Made for TV""-ish to warrant any other noms"
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,Malcom X is my favorite movie. He DEFINITELY should have won for that one.
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U," @macewbee  Halle Berry shouldn't even share a cab with share a cab with Denzel, much less the same level of acclaim.  She's barely an actress.  He's a living legend."
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U," @B-Mag  That was a good year for film, and I agree on RDJ. Chaplin has strong moments but his performance is stellar. I also think Crying Game was really good but felt Stephen Rea's performance was kind of flat and meh. Honestly, I felt Jaye Davidson was better than Stephen Rea in the movie."
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"I liked Al Pacino in that role but after watching Malcolm X, gonna agree with you here. He should have edged out Pacino. And Pacino arguably should have got his Oscar in earlier roles as well."
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"​ @Iron Bridge  100% agree. Pacino should have won supporting in '93 for Glen Gary Ross, and as Best Actor for Serpico way back in the 1970s."
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"Totally agree. For me, if you forget the actor and see just the character, that is a win in my book."
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"100% agree. Scent of a Woman wasn't really particularly good film, IMHO. Malcom X was the pinnacle of the career of one of the (if not *the*) greatest actors the world has ever known."
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"Here we go, another fool bringing race into the mix. When Jamie won for Ray, was that the Academy awarding him for playing a villain. Or was it because Jamie gave an impeccable performance and was rightly rewarded for it? Though I agree that Denzel should have won for X, especially over the Gonzo performance of Al Pacino in Scent of a woman. You could also argue Pacino was overlooked for Godfather part 2, Norton should have won for American History X, De Niro for Taxi Driver, Tom Cruise for Magnolia and the list goes on. It's just a coincidence that Denzel won for being a slave (great performance) and for playing a corrupt cop. The latter was because he played against type. I'm one of those people, who thinks his Training Day performance didn't even deserve an Oscar. It's a decent thriller with a good performance, but if you look at the acting. It's in the same wheel house as most other Denzel performances. Denzel doesn't add anything new to his acting style. It's still those Denzelism's we see in almost every mid budget film he puts out. It's the cool walk, the random monologues, the death stares, that Grinch like grin etc. It just so happens that the script has him do bad things. Yet none of those bad things seem all that shocking or terrifying. I laughed when he did all his ""bad guy antics"" and that last monologue where he gets shot in the ass and still gives his obligatory speech. That s*** was utterly hilarious. Not the reaction an Oscar winning villain should illicit."
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"the most chilling part to me was how he tries to call his son to him during the house shootout, and it's pretty obvious that he only wants the kid to come to him so he can use him as a shield. that's the lowest of the low type of tactics, but shows alonso will do absolutely anything to get away with his crimes."
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"Looking back years ago when I watched this for the first time (as a teen), I can't help but laugh at myself for constantly denying the possibility/fact that Denzel's character was the bad guy. 😅 I kept justifying each and every action he did as I watched the whole thing. It was only near the end, at the scene wherein Ethan's character confronted him as he was stashing all the money in the bag that I finally accepted the fact that Denzel's character was indeed the bad guy after all. 😄"
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,That means DW did a good job
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"This was great, but there's one thing I wanna point out: Alonzo was never well-intentioned. As a police officer, there's no reason he should live where he does other than to terrorize the people he grew up with. He grew up in that same neighborhood with those same neighbors and became an officer to hold the power of the law over them while engaging in the same crime. Except for him it wasn't a means of surviving poverty because he had already escaped poverty. His entire career and every decision he made in his life was all in service of his power fantasy."
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"Denzel Washington elevates everything he does. He’s the best living actor today. More soulful than Daniel Day Lewis, more versatile than Leo DiCaprio, and a performer who digs deeper into the meaning of dialogue and movements than any one else today. “King Kong ain’t got shit on me!” is a mantra for his life."
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"If you've ever been in the streets and dealt with a duplicitous manipulative snake,   You felt the greatness of that performance."

movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,Alonso is basically “What If Obi-Wan was Darth Vader?” and it’s incredible!!!
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,A few semesters ago in college I took a screen writing class and one day we actually watched this scene to analyze how the writer explains to the audience who Alonzo is through normal dialogue
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,Denzel is literally one of the realest guy in Hollywood to this day. I actually miss the times where a movie like training day was enjoyable from the beginning to the end.When you compare this to the wanna be thrillers nowadays it all seems like a bad dream.They tried with all the little things but it was just miserable and not even Denzel could make the movie good although he did his best.
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"Training Day has one of the greatest first 10-minutes in movie history.I often just watch the first 10 minutes, talk about efficient story telling."

For me, this film brought some levity to all the insanity that was happening IRL. I will always love it for it."
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,Washington played the character of Alonso down to every detail. The combination of Washington and Hawk catapulted this movie to an instant classic
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"That's a different reading of Denzel's character than I had.Rather than a tragic tale of a man corrupted by power and gritty urban cop work, I saw Alonzo Harris as a narcissist and sociopathic liar who serves no higher purpose than himself. He's disingenuous about everything he says. ""I walk a higher path"" is BS. His code is just a smokescreen to deceive and manipulate. If he wasn't a cop he would he selling used cars of dubious reliability.What part of the movie is supposed to alert the audience he used to be a good person?"

movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,this is my favorite movie of all time stemming back to when I was a kid. I remember wanting to be as smooth and calculating as Alonzo but not for bad things for good. Denzel's performance was so good throughout the movie as a kid I stopped seeing Denzel and only saw Alonzo. then watching movies like Remember the Titans or his Malcolm X movie was jarring for me how he almost shape shifts into a new person . Great video
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"Oh yes, Training Day was such an experience that broke the mind-numbing pleasure I got from action movies and it made me seek more complex stories. Thanks for the video, what a bittersweet reminder ✌🏼"
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"Just my 2 cents: Alonzo doesnt ""deep down know he is the villain"" he simply realizes that the hero/villain dichotomy is too simplistic and that he instead is a predator taking his share sometimes at the expense of innocent people."

movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,"Give John David Washington a crack being Alonzo. He’s a really solid actor who can carry a drama and action. Also, he’s about as close as you can get to Denzel. Also, the ages line up well based on the rumor that the prequel would take place in 1992 during the LA Riots.JDW is about 10 years younger than Denzel when he played Alonzo with the prequel film taking place 9 years before the original."

movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,“Deja Vu” and “The Bone Collector” two of my favourite movies. Also with D Washington.
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,2EN-lG0Ho4U,I think the key is to understand that Alonzo always planned on killing him. He was literally chosen to die.Whenever I watch the film again that first scene in the diner seems the most sinister.

movies with a morally justified villain recommend,Pr9ruvxA3K4,"My best date was probably the day after this past Valentine’s day. Both of our schedules were so conflicting that we didn’t have time for a sit down fancy meal so I suggested Buffalo Wild Wings which is BOMB. I don’t need a four-course meal to be wined and dined, chips and queso along with wings are just fine. Of course I got the cutest gifts, so I was a very happy girl that day. My worst date was with a guy that ended up having to bring his friends along and then ordered a kids meal so then I felt obligated to order a kids meal. I was so hungry and felt awkward and the night ended with a very awkward kiss. I immediately friend zoned him."

movies with a morally justified villain recommend,Pr9ruvxA3K4,"This movie Inspired me when I was young to get into the caregiver field ( I’ve been told I’d be an amazing nurse but I can’t handle blood and such lol ) so instead I’ve had the honor to share in lives of adults with a wide range of physical and mental disabilities, and help them to live there best life ….. I’ve been through many trainings and we are told time and time again to not become attached to the people we serve , I’ve been told many times that they are not our friends and we must maintain professionalism at all times , but these same “instructor’s “ have never spent countless hours day in and day out with these individuals, they haven’t held there hands as they faced there fears , or been the only one who calms them down and provide them with that safe feeling they need , haven’t taken walks in the park and seen there eyes light up and excitement in there face to see flowers or wildlife , haven’t been on adventures , I understand the concept of professionalism and distance but as a human you will form a bond of some sort with them and grow attached , and I’ve learned to just like he says , if you treat them as a person and with dignity and respect then everyone wins but if you treat them like they are just another “special needs condition “ or your paycheck , then no one wins and you miss out on an opportunity to create something beautiful in both of your lives and you can still do that while being professional and have that boundary ( I hope that makes sense ) ❤️ life is a beautiful thing"

movies with a morally justified villain recommend,PJktJhSeuOs,"I completely disagree with this list 1.

Shere Khan isn't that bad given that 1. He has some honor 2. He can be seen as an extremist 3. He has huge moral agency issues due to being a tiger and a tigers concept of morality is much different than a humans since tigers have been known to kill humans for more petty reasons than Shere Khan did4. He fails the live action Disney heinous standards SEVERELYAnd finally the Red Queen redeemed herself so she shouldn't be where she is."
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,PJktJhSeuOs,The live action Jafar was way more evil than the original animated one. At least the original was  somewhat charismatic. And he cared about Iago while the live action one didn't. I was thinking that when me and my mom went to see the live action movie in theaters.
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,PJktJhSeuOs,Yeah I don't really like this version of Jafar and yes it is pretty much confirmed that the original Jafar had some care for Iago given that in a story detailing an alternate timeline Jafar was forced to kill Iago in a ritual and it's made very clear that he didn't want to and he felt bad about it.

movies with a morally justified villain recommend,PJktJhSeuOs,"Sorry but I disagree with some of these rankings, although Shere Khan is a lot more evil than his animated counterpart I still think Scar is a lot more evil than him, Jafar, The Red Queen etc. I also think Lord Cutler Beckett is the most evil villain in the Pirates Of The Caribbean movies but I guess I can understand you going with Davy Jones because he’s more iconic I guess."
movies with a morally justified villain recommend,PJktJhSeuOs,"Yeah they messed up with quite a lot of this for example I'd say Shere Khan is just barely more evil than Lady Tremaine and definitely not as bad as Gaston especially since 1. Everything Shere Khan did actually isn't out of place for a normal tiger, an example is when a tiger killed a hunter and several other people just for that 1 hunter stealing a part of it's kill so someone permanently blinding a tiger is going to be a big deal so yeah. 2. He can be seen as an extremist given that he does have a point for why he hates humans 3. He does have some sense of honor as he respects the water truce4. He fails the Disney live action heinous standards severely.  2. The Red Queen has several redeeming qualities including a literal redemption so yeah no they ranked her as WAY too evil 3. Bori Khan has 1 redeeming quality that being that he did care about his father and wanted to avenge him and while he isn't tragic, it's enough to garner some sympathy, even though I still think he's a terrible character ( in terms of writing) so yeah no he's not as evil as someone like Lord Cutler Beckett or even Armando Salazar. 4. Davy Jones has too many redeeming qualities to be ranked as worse than Jafar since he's tragic, he genuinely loved Calypso and was heartbroken when he thought she betrayed him, he has some standards as he's shocked when he saw that Jack was so willing to sign over 100 souls in his place, and he shows remorse on some occasions so yeah no Davy Jones should be ranked as less evil."

movies with a morally justified villain recommend,fUlGtrHCGzs,"Niccolo Machiavelli was among the first thinkers to apply secular thoughts in studying politics, in line of the Renaissance zeitgeist. Political thought before Machiavelli was dominated by Christian morality: good rulers were virtuous, honest, God-fearing, Christian. Since Machiavelli was a student of history of the Classical Age (and had first-hand experiences in diplomacy, political turmoils and events in Europe), he yearned for the glorious age of the Roman Empire--stability and power. He removed the Christian deux ex machina that ""GOD"" or miracles had a hand of human history, and replaced it with human agencies. Machiavelli remained Catholic all throughout his life, but he believed that in ruling a nation/state, values and morality were hindrances, if not impractical nor susceptible to political intrigues. Hence, ""the end justifies the means."""

movies with a morally justified villain recommend,fUlGtrHCGzs,"One of the listed virtues by Machiavelli was being religious and even noted some historical characters that were not religious and were described as almost nihilistic psychopaths.

Politicians might have to raise taxes and go against their beliefs in order to save the economy just like what George H.W Bush did when he raised taxes despite saying ""Read my lips; No new taxes"" in order to fix the budget deficit that was created by Ronald Reagan. I think the point Machiavelli was trying to make us see that the world we live in is not perfect and all of the bad actions we do today in order to serve the greater good or if its just unrealistic and impossible to achieve perfection and what we want, is the price of dealing with the world as it is, and not how it should be."

Spanish movies recommend,7-iMt9uH-pA,"What a great list Emma, thanks for the recommendations!. There is another Spanish thriller staring Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem called ""Todos lo saben"" or in English ""Everybody Knows"". I really enjoyed that one!!. slow pace but good!!."
Spanish movies recommend,7-iMt9uH-pA,Oooo thank you
Spanish movies recommend,7-iMt9uH-pA,"Great list including some that I didn't knew about. A couple of others are El Arte De Morir(The Art Of Dying), Memorias De Un Angel Caido(this one is hard to find), Matador(from Pedro Almodovar) and El Dia De La Bestia(Day Of The Beast not thriller but very good). There's a lot of Spanish horror movies that don't get released abroad. Good reviews and cool video Emma!👍"
Spanish movies recommend,7-iMt9uH-pA,"Oriol Paulo is the one of the most underrated and probably my favorite Spanish director. The invisible guest, Mirage and The Body are masterpieces. And having read the synopsis of his next movie, Los Renglenos Tocidos De Dios, it looks like it's going to be as twisty as his previous ones."
Spanish movies recommend,7-iMt9uH-pA,"I love the Baztan trilogy movies, all available on Netflix. So atmospheric,  and the lead actress is great. They are thrillers, but have an element of dark folklore."
Spanish movies recommend,7-iMt9uH-pA,Eye for an EyeOriginal title: Quien a hierro mataVery good Spanish thriller about a nurse seeking revenge on his gangster patient. A lot of good twists and mind games. Luis Tosar is excellent.
Spanish movies recommend,7-iMt9uH-pA,"This was a list I didn’t know I needed! I’m excited about quite a few of these, so I know what I’ll be watching this week! Thanks for all your hard work, Emma. My watchlist needs you."

Spanish movies recommend,7-iMt9uH-pA,"I personally love ""Nadie Conoce a Nadie"" with Eduardo Noriega and Paz Vega. I watched it during a film festival at Uni like a million years ago and I've never seen anyone speak about it. If you haven't, give it a try please. I'd love to hear your opinion about it."

Spanish movies recommend,7-iMt9uH-pA,Yeah I found that out too when I started searching so strange!! I wish there was a Spanish language original
Spanish movies recommend,7-iMt9uH-pA,"Thanks for this Emma, I just got into this I guess ""sub-genre"" recently after watching Julias Eyes and The Body recently."
Spanish movies recommend,7-iMt9uH-pA,"Thanks Emma. Once again you're out there surfing to waves for us. One of my favorites is Sin Nombre (The Nameless) which is really more of a cult horror film, but seriously thrillery as well. But I'm sure you already know it."
Spanish movies recommend,7-iMt9uH-pA,Cheers Emma ! Spanish horror/thriller is very underrated . Stay spooky 👻
Spanish movies recommend,7-iMt9uH-pA,Yes
Spanish movies recommend,7-iMt9uH-pA,Certainly
Spanish movies recommend,7-iMt9uH-pA,"This is why I love your channel. You look at everything in the horror genre not just what is known/English/American. I often see these horror YouTubers with a audience make top 10 underrated videos about final girls, slashers, etc. And often it's just the same English movies that are a little less known and not the real underrated stuff from around the world."
Spanish movies recommend,7-iMt9uH-pA,"Spanish movies are almost always a gift,I loved 'mirage' and 'the orphanage' and also 'rec'"

I am blessed by God to have had great jobs or I would have lost my house, not to mention lost my life! I drew my SSDI when I was 49, so I had 17 years more to work to increase my social security.

action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,"I think “The Hunt” and “The Hills Have Eyes 2” has been mislabeled as going too far.  They are both great movies and the evaluation of them was mishandled, as if they hadn’t been viewed. “The Hunt” isn’t about liberals’ vs conservatives.  It’s about rich people hunting down those individuals they hold responsible for the social media attacks against them, which forced them to lose standing in companies or society at large.  The reason for these attacks stem from private text messages they had with each other about hunting and killing people on a special ranch someone owns.  However, they were just talking crap, but that didn’t matter, which prompts them to do what they were accused of.  What makes this movie unique and hilarious, stems from people doing what they were accused of and blaming those they are killing, for getting killed by them.  The hilarious part is the mistake they make by grabbing one wrong person, who has the talents needed to survive.  That person has the same name and lives in the same town as the one they should have gotten.  That person kills all the hunters and gets flown back to civilization. “The Hills Have Eyes 2” does have rape scenes and there is a woman who gives birth after being raped.  However, we’re not talking about regular people doing the assaults, but mutants who have been living in an area that was used for nuclear testing.  Their only means of procreation is taking women they find and taking what they want.  You also have to remember that this movie is connected in some small fashion to three others; The Hills Have Eyes (1977), The Hills Have Eyes Part II (1984), and The Hills Have Eyes (2006).  However, unlike these other movies, you have nation guard trainees to take them on, who have weapons to defend themselves with.  I like “The Hills Have Eyes 2” because of this difference, but also the way some people grow as individual, while others who always appeared to have it together, show it was all bravado."

This is directly against the rules of war and immediate execution on a spot is justified.

For many, that kind of visceral scene is the very reason they like the film in the first place. And then ""pansies"" proceed to rip it apart for that reason... Attempts at making worthwhile art can offend, but it doesn't mean it shouldn't be attempted or consumed (a lot of critics suggest it shouldn't).Edit: I guess my point is it's a fair bit more nuanced (the reason why people get upset at critics) than just ""internet tough guys"" getting offended by offended people.

action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,Not many
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,True movie fans want to know what movies made critics butts hurt. That's how we know it's a good movie.
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,"These aren't even reviewers, it's just a content farm."
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,I certainly don't.
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,"The interview was such a good movie for what it provided. However I found the ending very sad, even though funny at the same time."
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,"The hunt was great. Made me really think about my behaviours in the political spectrum, and I think it had equal Jabs and laughs against both sides, right and left. Was a fun movie and I quite recommend it. I don't really see where it went too far."
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,I haven't gone to see a film in theater since Prometheus. And I think it was at least 10 years hiatus prior to that. There is a constant flow of crap flowing from the conglomerate entertainment machine.  One of the best films I've seen in a long time was ex-mechina (and indy film). Refreshingly brilliant in every aspect of production.
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,I feel same way. It’s not unusual.
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,For me Prometheous was the worst science fiction movie of my time circa 2013.
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,The interview is one of my favourite comedies of all time!!😂 absolutely hilarious!!😂
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,Zack and Miri was hilarious
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,"Like the Hunt  and the Interview, Some movies are judged before they even come out. I remember when Last Temptation of Christ came out, people were in an uproar over a dream sequence. That dream was the least offensive part of that movie."
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,"""Banned in movie theaters"" in the land of the free, home of the brave. How about I worry about what I watch or don't. Thank you."
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,10:45 nothing about apocalypse rising should be changed. It was simply a beautiful movie. It was stunning. It was perfect.
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,Half the movies you listed were hilarious and it's a pox on Hollywood that they seem unable (or unwilling) to make such good movies any more.
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,"I'm more right leaning and never heard of the hunt, the premise actually sounds interesting. The few clips show some of them as gun and hunting enthusiasts, then thrown into a game of the hunt. Was it any good?"
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,"I loved the Hunt, it was funny and I got used to the gore, as I have a weak stomach, by watching Dead Meat!"
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,"Here's the thing, The Hunt is actually speaking out against both far left and far right. The protagonist hero isn't actually right wing, they're centrist. People who didn't really look into the film beyond surface level seem to have missed that. The film didn't take things too far, in fact the over reaction from both left and right REINFORCES the film's point.and after seeing this video it's clear the writers nards are missing due to an overabundance of feminist doctrine. It's funny how now i wait to see what ideologues are offended by to find out what shows and movies are actually entertaining"
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,The Hunt was surprisingly hilarious.
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,I thought Movie 43 was going to be awesome.  I mean the casting looked amazing.  Then I watched it and thought what were these people thinking.  It was a train-wreck.
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,"The Hunt was good, it did a good job of showing how close we are to a complete snowflake melt down."
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,"Oliver Stone did not write the Natural born killers, he screenplayed it though. Tarantino wrote it."
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,"The Most Dangerous Game became reality in the form of the Australian Serial Killer Ivan Milat, The Backpacker Killer of Belanglo and the man who inspired Wolf Creek"
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,When some YouTube channels  talk about the film most dangerous game. and how it influence the hunt people seem to forget that Ice-T film surviving the game .Which is a classic in my opinion
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,I don't hate hangover 2. It was good and that's how a person would act.
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,I love the interview. That and tropic thunder are my 2 fav comedies of all time.
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,"Is R basically an 18? If so, I don't see why filmmakers are so bothered about not being R rated, people go to the flicks under the certified age all the time."
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,"Bullshit. I agree with Monsterman. And the ""Hunt"" was awesome and funny as hell!"
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,The Hunt was the only good Horror flick I've seen in the past two years.
action movies from 60s recommend,ops0vB6Nfm8,Zack and Miri was a pretty sweet movie.....I don't remember it being over the top offensive but some of my friends did. Movie 43 was complete trash except for the locker room scene near the end when Terrence Howard kills with his motivational speech🙂.

movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ,"Watch Antique 서양골동양과자점 앤티크 now on:On Demand Korea https://bityl.co/6COr"
movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ,Love your channel 
movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ,I love the fact in manga ... the chef and the bodyguard end up together- at least the official doujinshi
movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ,What's the manga name?
movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ, @dany collins  also antique bakery
movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ," @AEle 03  okay, thanks."
movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ,I thought the body guard end up with his master.
movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ,I hoped owner of bakery will be with chef :(
movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ,So wait in the show they dont end up together then?
movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ, @Gustavo Gomez  in the movie no:.. in the official manga also no.. but in the doujinshi by the mangaka ( which I consider as basically canon) the bodyguard ended up with the chef... the owner is a sliding scale but pretty on the straight side of the scale most of the time
movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ,This was hilariously awesome... Kim Jae Wook looked handsome  in long hair....
movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ,Nooo..  he looked beautiful
movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ,Hahaha the guys at the bar were angry when he said he's cute

movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ, I can see now
movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ, @TaeTobio  I see it as a way that he already marked his target so there's no chance for them that day.
movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ,i LOVE this tv show. Its comedy mixed with mystery. I loved it so much. When Thailand announced their bakery tv show to air. I thought of this one.

movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ,Sun woo is so pretty indeed....wished it could have had a more detailed ending or another part
movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ,I watch this a lot of time but the anime version is still my fav. It's more BL 
movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ,Wah.. I actually forgot this gem existed I guess that's because the online version didn't have this scene  the physical version did...  I think they already filtered the online versions because the concept is still strongly taboo in public that time
movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ,"Eversince Coffee Prince Jae Wook has always been my biggest crush. I'm not familiar with this drama until now and I find it very  funny.  Can I watch it in Kiss asian, Viki or Netflix??? Kamsahamnida "

movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ, @alice cruse  ı think they changed the scenes order. bc there is no new scenes in it. ı wish there were

movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ, @Oh Ha Ni chan  no I didn't remember seeing it either so I went back and watched it again and it's not there in one version but then I found a physical DVD and that has it so I guess it's just incomplete in some places
movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ, @pooja kumari  thanks
movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ,"I feel like that new upcoming bl for Singto, Lee, and Pluem are inspired by this it's like the same setup and some similar characters"

movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ,Hahaha why were they so angry when he complemented him?
movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ,They were all interested in the guy with sun glasses but when Jae wook called him cute everyone knew they had no chance with the guy with sunglasses It was so funny
movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ, @BabyBoop  I see it as they all wanted Sunwoo. The guy on their right was judging Suyoung so hard lmao
movies where a man is victim recommend,w_6ID8hpiNQ,What did I just watch? Antique bakery??? And why the heck did I think they were Japanese at first?!

Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,it is so simple that you didn't watch mr nobody

Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,I originThe skin i live insecret windowruby sparksthe machinist
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,I know that's from 4 months ago but I watched a couple of these and I gotta say that you've got a stellar list here. Can't wait to check out the others on this list. Only recommendation I could add is Into The Wild. Not a thriller but a pretty worthwhile watch.
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,so have you watched them all yet??
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,A lot of these are not mindblowing
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,"I saw it in theatres when I was 13 years old, and I've seen it like five more times since then. Yeah I think I do. I just enjoyed Shutter Island a lot more. I'm not saying Inception is a bad movie or anything like that, because it definitely is not. Both great movies."
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,1. Inception2. Shutter Island100% agree
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,"I am very surprised no one has mentioned has mentioned Vanilla Sky. It starts off on the dramatic side, then takes a huge turn and boom! Mindgasm. I had to be alone for a few minutes after the movie ended to think to myself. It changed my perception of things in a beautiful way. Hope you guys enjoy it as much as I did."
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,Is it a good movie ?
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk, @68 Mallikarjun Desai  i mean thats what he's saying
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,Vanilla sky is alright
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,"I actually love these kind of of videos. Great fun as always. I just began doing my own top 5 videos again after making too many political vids. They are so fun to make, hope that I can get to the quality here in time. Let me know if you guys have any suggestions!!"
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,"There is a fine line between clever storytelling and bad storytelling.Movies like coherence, triangle, inception, you can figure out soon after. then you watch mulholland drive and its like ""WTF is going on""?"
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,totally different genres. mullholland drive is totally meant to be surreal and incoherent
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,"If you liked Primer, try Timecrimes. It is basically a simplified version but still hits the spot."
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,predestination is underrated but a great movie
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,its my favorite
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk, @Shoab Baloch  true
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk," @Eam Fam  Second favorite, under Memento."
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk, @Alex Roodman  been wanting to watch that movie but the trailer kinda spoiled the movie not sure if should 
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk," @Eam Fam  The trailer is much worse than the movie. Even with the hint, there's a lot to find in the movie."
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,watching it now 
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,"what if i told you, i predicted the plot after reading the tittle?"
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,Guys it aint a movie. But lately i've been watching the series; Westworld. If you haven't seen it i would recommend watching it! :D

Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,"Donnie Darko, one of the best movies ever made and will make you focus in hard. Also a great movie to watch when you’re high, that’s always a good thing."
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,triangle is the deepest and most blowmind movie ever

Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,Momento for me will always be the deepest mind fuck.
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,Astral'o Pithecus  yea coherence is a better movie than triangle probably

Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,Donnie darko is soooo good if you learn why everything happens
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,Please can you explainI'm stuck

Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,what abt predestination?
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,"Eraserhead, stalker, the mirror, 2001, lost highway and Mullholand drive are all more mindfucks than inception"
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,Contratiempo (The Invisible Guest) is very underrated
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,Amazing List! 3 out of the 10 movies are from Christopher Nolan. I'd put Interstellar there too. 
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,Memento were utterly existential
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,"Good list, I've seen some but will check out the rest ... I've seen Clockwork Orange, Donnie Darko, memento, and Fight Club...all really good /so I expect I will like the ones I haven't seen ."
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,"Movies that gave me much bigger mindfucks: ""Eraserhead"", ""Dellamorte Dellamore"", ""Mulholland Drive"", ""Lost Highway"", ""Tetsuo: The Iron Man"""
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,"mulholand drive, enemy (ending makes us look like shit), coherence  , and finally Primer (nothing beats this movie)"
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,You can add to that list 'La piel que habito'A must see creepy movie !
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,What would actually happen if Donnie Darko took trippy psychedelics like LSD?
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,came here for one but found that I have watched all of them 😂
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,"I wouldn`t add butterfly effect or the prestige neither, I think they  are comercial empty movies . Instead of those i would add The Incredible Shrinking Man due to ending mologue  , Coherence... Eraser head if you want to go harder XD... but I think the  Cabinet of Dr. Caligari  is the most mindfucking film ever"
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,Primal fear. Fucking awesome ending.
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,#1 should be The Game (1997) .... that movie was crazy !
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,"I just love this comment section, full of beautiful movie recommendations ❤️❤️Thanks a ton everyone."
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,"Fight Club is the most overrated film ever! (I've been told the book is great). Tale of two Sisters is a much more accurate portrayal.... Also, if you want a fucked up film, watch Visitor Q!"
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,The prestige is my favorite by far.
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,In fight club there is a scene where he is fighting with his inner self and at a moment it looks like an invisible entity is pulling him while the audience looks through the camera on the ceiling.
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,"Primer, Upstream Color, Enemy, Under The Skin, Moon, Coherence, The One I Love, Stoker, Predestination, Memento, Don Jon, The Lobster"
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,i don't know why but these kind of movies give special feels
Mindfuck movies recommend,vKEatwG_kXk,Predestination missing.. That should have been on the top 3

Mindfuck movies recommend,cgz-F_2ojP4,Y’all should watch pre destination
Mindfuck movies recommend,cgz-F_2ojP4,You should watch Triangle
Mindfuck movies recommend,cgz-F_2ojP4,predestination is boring as hell. good storyline but super poor execution. if you like slow burner then it's for you . for me it was not entertained. it was confusing for over 1 hour.
Mindfuck movies recommend,cgz-F_2ojP4, @Trang nguyen  you got confused 🤣🤣
Mindfuck movies recommend,cgz-F_2ojP4,Double & Time Lapse are amazing.
Mindfuck movies recommend,cgz-F_2ojP4,really mind blown with time lapse. With such low budget they made very cool movie. Better than any hollywood movies.

Mindfuck movies recommend,cgz-F_2ojP4,Thank goodness I don’t even know where to start🥳🤩
Mindfuck movies recommend,cgz-F_2ojP4,why is tenet and inception not in this
Mindfuck movies recommend,cgz-F_2ojP4,Because everyone knows these over rated
Mindfuck movies recommend,cgz-F_2ojP4,Cuz tenet didn't exist half a year ago
Mindfuck movies recommend,cgz-F_2ojP4,it’s good because everybody watched them and sometimes i’m looking for movies that are never mentioned by anyone.. movies i haven’t heared of or watched already
Mindfuck movies recommend,cgz-F_2ojP4, @localvoid  that's a fact tho lol
Mindfuck movies recommend,cgz-F_2ojP4, @localvoid   or did it???
Mindfuck movies recommend,cgz-F_2ojP4,lol inception is easy to understand
Mindfuck movies recommend,cgz-F_2ojP4,or The Prestige? Forgotten? Memento?
Mindfuck movies recommend,cgz-F_2ojP4,Interstellar? Nolan's movie?
Mindfuck movies recommend,cgz-F_2ojP4,"Because everyone already knows about them. We are here to find what to watch, not to validate what we think."

Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,Vanilla Sky (adaptation of abre los ojos) is movie with deeper perspective of life! In a way it depresses me and also encourages me want to make the best of this so called miserable thing known as life! Not everyone should watch this... Especially people who are in deep emotional pain or are deeply driven by emotions! No other movie in this list or outside can replace this! This will have special place in my heart forever! I'm glad not everyone has seen this movie! Any sentient being wouldn't be able to stop their tears while watching this movie! “Every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around.” - Sofia 
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,Amazing ️️
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,Shutter island is by-far the most brilliant movie ever created

Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,"No other sci-fi movie can touch the level of the masterpiece ""INCEPTION""️️️What a legendary actor Leonardo DiCaprio And what a legendary Director Christopher Nolan is"
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,Agree️️
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,2001 is better than inception. U will know once ypu watch it. Inception was a rip off of paprika.
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,2001 : A Space Odyssey (1968)Star Wars : A New Hope (1977)The Matrix (1999)
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,Watch tenet
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,"Leonardo DiCaprio isn't a legend, he is just overrated. He acts all same in every film (he just plays himself)Also, in many films he overacts; and his performance is totally unrealistic. (Like Inception)I ain't trying to say that he is a bad actor, he is a goddamn great actor.His facial expression, the way he delivers the dialogues, everything is fine,but his body language isn't.He tries too much hard in his films.Most of the internet sources call Leo DiCaprio as the most overrated actor of the generation And he is."
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,"The list is fab! Inception, Eternal Sunshine and Shutter Island are definitely my favourites, but I needed to spend 3 watch to completely comprehend Predestination. It was a deep theory tightly packed in a nutshell. Interstellar, memento and Machinist are cool too! Just wish movies like this are made in India too ."
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,I wish too..️But indian Audience choose so pathetic..Films like Baghii & Dabangg etc.So I don't think..that Hollywood type of cinema can be Ever made in India.
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,I already seenInceptionFight clubThe game ( my favourite)InterstellarVanilla skyShutter Island ( favourite)MementoAll movies are beyond imagination 
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,have you seen saw ?? if not then watch all 7 parts of saw and reply me back
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,Damm i havent seen many other movies in the list but only those who see dreams during sleep can understand inception.  I mean to what extent did he carry out research for this movie.  NOLAN is a legend
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,Exactly... Brother...What a MASTERPIECE..
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,"Inception was inspired from ""Paprika"" it's an anime movie which was released in 2006"
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,"Yes,.. I got to know..this..from my friend."
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,Shutter island and Inception are masterpiece️️
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,️️
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,It's true
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,Christopher Nolan is 1000 miles ahead from normal Brian.  Unbelievable imagination beyond complex grip of James Cameron
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,️️
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,Christoper Nolan is my all-time favorite director..
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,Also my favourite too ️️
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,Thank you
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,I saw most of this movies and they are all great but Eternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind was maybe the best movie I’ve ever seen. Mr Nobody and Interstellar were so great too
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,️
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,Yep ️
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,Christopher Nolan do always making masterpieces.........
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,"You forgot to mention Mirage movie. I just watched it, a complete masterpiece it is "
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,Yes 
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,Yes I've already watched Predestination and it was confusing but  if you focus on every line then you would finally understand the whole movie at once. And list was great I've had already added most of them in my watch list but few were missing in your list glad I found
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,Thank u so much ️ I will improve my videos in future..️
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg, @Super Duper Filmy  Yeah best of luck for your channel. I am sure you will have 100k soonJust include IMDB ratings and  just rarely mention ratings below 6. I've too made my list of all movies and every kind of series like yours but the difference is I haven't posted. 
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,"Interstellar , Inception, fight club, mr nobody  and predestination  all are my most favourite movies️"
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,"Try Chris Nolan's first movie Following. Its a masterpiece too. Cobb (same name as of inception) is the main character here too. And you can include a little bit complex movies than Chris Nolan's movies like Fountain (Cast Hugh Jackman, director Darren Aronofsky), Black Swan , Mother!. They are much more complex than memento, inception or Interstellar. You can add Enemy, source code too. Adding Mr Nobody, Vanilla Sky etc in the list is awesome (Shutter Island is one of my favourites). Thanks for sharing the list , I came to new movie names which I didn't watched till now. Thanks a lot. Try the web series Dark (Its a pro version of Predestination and better mystery presentation than Prisoners)"
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,Awesome list brother. I have seen most of them but there are few which I have missed and will watch thanks to your video. List can continue with another David Fincher movie named Se7en and another one called The usual suspects. Both are a bit mind bogging.
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,David fincher is a legend.. He has his own genre
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,I hav already watched 80%of these moviesBelieve me best list ever
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,"Inception is a great movie, but honestly I understand that movie in my first watch. Leonardo Decaprio's movie are unique. I love that man's choice of work"
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,Prisoners and invisible suspect deserves a place in the listPrisoners doesnt have a surprise twist but its a 7/10 movieThe prestige did not get me but its a 7/10 movie alsoShutter island inception are the 'must watch' movies 10/10Anyway great list..
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,For me the only movie that caught me off guard WAS PREDESTINATION! Nhi dekhi to dekho. Underrated and truly a masterpiece.
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,I understood InceptionThe prestigeFight clubPredestinationMementoAfter seeing once
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,"Christopher Nolan is mighty brain, extremely extremely stunning quality work provider"
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,Best Psychological Thriller Movies are of Varun Dhawan. I can't understand them... What kind of Logic they use?? Unpredictable!!
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,Mr. Nobody has a lot of feels and thought to it rather than just mindfuck. I believe it is one of the most well-directed movies and Interstellar is my all time favourite movie for the soundtracks and the breathtaking ending.
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,It's a  crime to compare dhoom3 to prestige... I don't know how could they even imagine to make such disastrous remake of this masterpiece
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,"wow...I have watched all movies in your list and I must say its good list thought. I really appreciate your effort.'The Jacket' , 'Time Crime', 'Cube', 'The exams', 'Circle' 'Triangle' and 'Time Lapes' also good and twisted movies which would be in top 10, just watch it you will thank me later.PS: Dont use badwords bro, I cant share your video in my family group now..."
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,"Great work , I have watched more than half movies in this list  but you have given out big spoiler or overall story of ""The Prestige"" by comparing it to Dhoom 3"
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,Legend CHRISTOPHER NOLAN is a Masterpiece️
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,Shutter island is the best. Trust me
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,Shutter Island should be on top 5 list.Because it is also a masterpiece.
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,You should have included A Beautiful Mind movie in honorable mentions
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,Who love Christopher Nolan Films. Like here
Mindfuck movies recommend,iKwAMFhMYNg,Predestination is fucking masterpiece

Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"This trope gave birth to the ""nice guys"" that wine about the ""friendzone""And it's horrifying"
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"Well that, and people who think women should be mind readers. Like, if you don't actually tell a woman how you feel about her, how can you whine about being friendzoned? It's like they can't imagine a women and men just being friends and expect the women to think all men they associate with are attracted to them, it's ridiculous."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"The ""I have a boyfriend"" as a tactic to get a man to leave a woman alone is problematic also. It assumes that a man will respect the boundaries of another man (i.e. the fictional or real boyfriend in this scenario), but will not respect the boundaries and wishes of the woman."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"I just wanted to take this moment to just let you know how much I appreciate the work you do. You might not fully realize it, but you're actually enacting real social change in those who view your work. A lot of these tropes are insidious and so generally accepted that it takes videos like these- videos that examine them earnestly and without flinching away- to help dismantle these toxic ideas about life that media tries to normalize."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"I just want to say for anyone who might see this, that I had a stalker who said he would kill himself if I didn't go out with him, but I still refused, and guess what? He didn't. And even if someone does hurt themselves, it is not your responsibility. You do not have to accept coercive offers made using manipulative tactics just to keep that person safe."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"This! People don't get it. It's like, ""Oh, divorce is bad for men because they are more likely to commit suicide."" Not her problem! No one should have to stay in a bad relationship even if vows were said."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"A good test: Put horror music over the scene. If it feels silly, the scene was okay. If it feels creepy.... you can use the scenes as an example for this video."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"I've had a stalker, and some of friends have had stalkers too. What's worse is sometimes cops, won't take your report seriously and have made comments like ""Clearly he likes you, maybe you should give him a shot."" Not cool at all."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,That’s a very important point. Makes me reconsider my “calling the cops” joke in this video.
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,Pop Culture Detective I didnt even take that as a joke.
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"One of my stalker was skinny and kinda short so when I told adults they just said that he wasn't a real threat to me and because I probably was stronger than him I should just try and ignore him, ugh"
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,Wow... that is truly terrifying.
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"Love the example of The Notebook. Everyone always claims it is THE romantic movie of the century, but as someone who has had a guy threaten to kill himself if I didn't go out with him, it always rubbed me the wrong way. That is not the way to start a relationship"
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"what I hate even more than him asking like that is her current dates reaction to her finally saying yes. Like, dude, are your seriously getting mad at her because she said yes to prevent a guy from killing himself? Neither of them were good men."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"This trope is so harmful! People think it's okay because the girls always end up reciprocating the feeling but it's absolutely not. And if a man doesn't respect a women's boundaries before they start dating he is sure as hell not going to respect them when they are in a relationship, which just makes it easier to create abusive relationships."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"For some reason, self-described ""nice guys"" fail to realize that these movies are fiction, so of course they end with the woman falling in love with the author-insert character. She's a fictional character, so she has no agency of her own.That doesn't mean that the same tactics are welcomed by real women."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"I fully agree! Women end up capitulating from being 'worn down' or worse they end up being manipulated into an unhealthy relationship.. and these things are glorified or romanticized by Hollywood. I think the Fifty shades saga is another perfect example of an abusive stalking for love dynamic. Hope that one gets reviewed soon. There we see an even more troubling trope - the idea that the perfect woman can reform or fix a deeply narcissistic or even sociopathic personality.  So many women fall for that trap in real life and don't even know how to recognize the boundary transgressions and controlling behaviors, they think that what they see in the movies is playing out for them in their lives but don't know what the real world consequences will be."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"As a lesbian woman, I would say that even I fell subject to a lot of this behavior and treated a lot of women similarly because that was what I had been shown worked in popular media. I feel so horrible about it now. There is never a good reason to think ""she just doesn't understand how much I love her"" and justify it as appropriate behavior when you continue to ignore her privacy and make her uncomfortable until she finally gives in to your demands."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"Holy cow, I've never seen The Notebook and never plan to, but the fact that Ryan Gosling's character pretty much forced Rachel Adams' to go out with him by threat of suicide is disgusting and how the hell is The Notebook some people's favorite romantic movie. Thanks for this wonderfully insightful video! This trope is especially common in Indian cinema (it's even worse over there), so more people need to not accept it as the norm."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,I don't think that is anyone's favorite part of the movie.
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"I remember a conversation I had with a woman who said she grew up believing she was ugly/a failure because no one stalked her in high school and college. She figured there must something horribly wrong with her since stalking behavior was what she grew up believing was the definition of romance. Eventually, in college, she got a stalker and married him. He ended up being horribly abusive and they divorced after two years. She now is a strong advocate against romance fiction in general."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"The amount of women in the comment section telling their own experiences with stalkers is overwhelming. This trope needs to be destroyedAlso thank you for including Adaline, i saw it recently and i couldn't believe my own eyes, she said no over and over and over again and yet..."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,Edurne Ace me too. I felt so angry when he just when to her house and then couldn't understand why she was angry. During the whole movie he appear so creepy to me.
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"It's funny (worrying actually) how I hear many men say: But this is what you want - women say this and only mean ""try harder"". And they honestly think that it is their experience telling them to keep going. While it truly must be ideas from films, series, etc."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,Edurne Ace Right?! I thought he was the bad guy and would end up trying to kill her or something. So much wrong with the romance in that movie.
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"This made me think of another thing I've seen a lot in movies: Boys or men who secretively watch a woman / girl getting undressed or showering etc. Like, boys peeking through a window / door, men sneaking a peek when they were told to turn away and not look while a woman is changing etc. And it's usually played as boys will be boys, this is natural curiosity, he is just so in love with her that he can't look away. I don't know. It's not as common and probably not big enough to call it a trope, but I find it super creepy and scary. (Also, there are probably example where women / girls whatch men / boys, I just can't think of any)"
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"Just last year I was on a study trip where a guy literally went through the whole checklist on one of my friends: watching her while she was asleep, bombing her with unwanted messages and memes, constantly trying to touch and following her. It was horrifying to see, most of all because it affected her so much. In just a week, her personality flipped completely, because he was constantly making her feel unsafe. And when she reported it to the organization, the reply she got was : Have you tried turning down your charm a bit?I could have killed them!"
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,As someone who’s been stalked more than once and is still dealing with the anxiety from it I can’t thank you enough. So sick of this behavior being celebrated in media. It definitely encourages this behavior to continue.
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"Love this. It's weird to see that it ACTUALLY has a real world impact. My ex was telling me about how this guy tried asking her out at an IHOP by having the entire IHOP staff carry a pancake to her with ""Will you go out with me?"" written on it. She wasn't interested, so she had to say no, but she nearly had an anxiety attack by being put on the spot and feeling heartless because she turned him down in front of all these people.It's not cute."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"""Romantic love is not something that only one person can feel towards another"" so important. I wish this would be said more often. I remember being sure I loved many people I had a crush on, before I actually got into a relationship and fell in love. This myth needs to stop."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"I agree. Ever notice how in the beginning of many rom coms, the protagonist is already with someone that they're bored of? They toss their stable, long-term relationships away for the sake of someone they just met. That's not love, that's infatuation, and it really pisses me off that these film's message is if your relationship requires any effort to maintain in any capacity, then you aren't meant to be."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"Interesting, that puts a new spin on the birth of Anteros."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"Not just the fact that women are attacked/raped/murdered by stalkers and the mental toll stalking takes, but it takes a monetary toll as well. Not just in moving a lot or paying for therapy, but also in things like losing employment. Many women have been fired or let go from their job because a stalker was causing problems or was posing a danger to the other employees/workplace. And most jobs feel it is the fault of the woman for being stalked in the first place. It is always ""you never should have dated him/ not dated him/said hi/etc. in the first place."" Partial blame is almost always partially placed on the woman being stalked. Stalkers don't just cause a little anxiety that women need to get over. Even when a stalker never does anything violent, they still ruin peoples lives."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"I LOVE that you used Morticia and Gomez as an example of healthy love. They are seriously goals. Respect boundaries, demonstrate love and caring, help and support each other-just ugh. Love your stuff as always."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"They totally are, looking back on the old Addams family movies these actually show a lot of good qualities that Gomez and Morticia have (in their love for each other and for their children). I think they are also one of the most positive married couples I can remember having seen portrayed in media in a funny way, without involving jokes on how marriage made them resent each other. They're just so darn happy together it's fantastic."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,They with Al and Lois from Malcolm in the middle are my perfect example of a functioning  fictional couple.
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,They're extremely honest with each other as well. It's done in a comedic way but it's still brilliant.
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,The joke about Addams family is not that they are creepy and spooky. The joke is that they are really really happy.
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"My mother was stalked when she was a teenager, and a guy would follow her home and wrote her notes in blood and threatened to kill himself if she rejected him. She did, and he ended up hospitalized from a suicide attempt. This romanticization of stalkers in media has only led to more women experiencing what my mom did. Thanks for shedding light on this topic."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"Yes yes yes thank you- a stalker once continually showed up at my work and finally delivered a huge bouquet of roses at a busy hour. My coworkers all cooed and when I expressed my revulsion, they said, “poor guy”. This shit really does shape our culture and perspectives."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"Marvelous video! It's also interesting to me how this relates to Pride & Prejudice, because people tend to interpret Darcy's actions as persistence and ""not giving up on making Lizzy love him"", but a good reading of the story is the exact opposite of the trope you discussed here. Darcy expresses his love to Lizzy, is surprised by her rejection, but takes her word on it. This is in direct contrast to her cousin mr. Collins, who ignores her rejection and thinks she's playing hard to get. Darcy instead believes her and...backs off. What he does for Lydia is not to gain Lizzy's trust or love, he just does it because he feels in a way responsible for Wickham and knows what the dude is capable of, so he does the family a favour by sparing them the scandal. Somehow, though, people completely miss this aspect of his character--that he respects women and their decisions, and doesn't impose his feelings upon them."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,I remember seeing a post insulting a woman in this guys class who didnt go outside to see a man who was waiting outside her school with a bouquet every day and i just thought this man is turning up somewhere he KNOWS she has to leave and cant avoid him and people are insulting HER for not rewarding him??? Its just so creepy that people find this behaviour sweet and romantic
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"I am 100% sure that my ""if he stalks me or obsesses over me, he really loves me"" mentality came from media like this.  It has ended me up in multiple abusive relationships and with a stalker.  Thank you so much for this."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"One of the creepiest things to me is something that Hollywood actresses have been doing for a LONG TIME.... and there’s an example of it in the video (Andie MacDowell in St. Elmo’s Fire)!! It’s when the male lead suddenly and unexpectedly kisses the female co-star, so she does the “ball my hands in a fist to fight you off, but wait, I actually like this, so I’m gonna put my arms around your neck instead.” It perfectly exemplifies this whole trope in one gesture. If a man kissed me, and my FIRST REACTION was to ball my hands up into fists because I’m about to punch him, my mind wouldn’t be changed by his soft lips or kissing ability. Because that’s fucking insane."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"I’ve never seen the Notebook, but OMFG did he actually threaten to kill himself if she didn’t go out with him??That is SO disgusting and so OBVIOUSLY abusive!! Why the hell do so many people love that movie?????!!!!!!!!!"
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,the characterization of a female character specifically through how a male character voyeuristically sees her has always bothered me. it always makes the girl an end goal rather than her own person.
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"Considering how often The Notebook is sighted as women's favourite film, I was shocked when I found that the male lead demands a date at the threat of suicide."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,The “forever and ever and ever.....” carved into all the trees is nightmare inducing holy god. WHO finds that romantic.
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"Even though my grandfather has dementia and can’t remember his own name, he tells my grandma that he loves her multiple times per day. That is love. Stalking isn’t."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"My ex (from over 10 years ago) has in recent months texted novels to me and my mother, written 14 page love letters from jail, broken into my apartment building, got on a friends fb pretending to be her to ambush me with my son at the playground, assaulted another friend to steal the my spare keys, tried to overdose outside my building, threatened to make false statements to the police and cps to get my son taken, and even threatened to kill me. He justified this by saying I gave him no choice because I wouldn't answer his calls. That he loved me so much and it was the least I could do to just let him be in my life and worship me (his words not mine). And I still had yet another friend try and say I was being unreasonable and should give him a chance. Thank you so much for making these videos and taking the time to explain what some of us just don't have the energy to.  This cultural reinforcement is insanely toxic and damaging to everyone involved and you stated why in a way I don't think I ever could."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"In college, I had a guy who actually believed if he stalked me enough, I'd return his feelings even after I explicitly told him I wasn't interested. (In fact, right after I explicitly told him ""no"", I got a text saying he'd wait for me to ""come to terms with my feelings."" Blegh! Blocked him). This all started in 2013 and I still occasionally need to block his puppet social media accounts."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"I am glad you're finally tackling this trope. It's been one that has bothered me for so long; it's creepy, annoying and almost unavoidable in mainstream media."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"This dude is out here pouring all the tea on Hollywood’s disturbing tropes, and I’m downing all of it"
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"I think at least part of the reason this trope exists is because it takes forming a relationship - something that usually involves stereotypically emotional, ""feminine"" concerns such as negotiation, compromise, talking about feelings and vulnerability, all of which might result in loss of face or loss of power for the male lead - and instead frames it as an ""uber-masculine"" activity: hunting. Identify the target, follow it, learn its habits and the times that its's most vulnerable, try to outsmart it when it becomes aware of your unwelcome presence, adapt your tactics to the terrain/circumstances, refuse to give up, drive it into a corner and beat other hunters to the prize.Throw in the fact that most of these films tend to be aimed at women, not men, and you've got a trope that's worrying on about twelve different levels."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"I love Stranger Things and I can sort of sympathize with Lucas's actions in season 2 because of he's in middle school and learning to navigate the confusing mess that is puberty (lord knows I did some cringey shit when I was that age) but that scene where Jonathan photographs Nancy is just straight-up creepy. It kinda ruined an otherwise sympathetic character that I saw a lot of myself in. When Steve smashed his camera I couldn't even feel that bad for him because... yeah dude, you don't fucking do that. I thought Nancy staying with Steve at the end of season 1 and just being friends with Jonathan was a great subversion of the 80's ""nice guy steals the girl away from the popular jerk"" trope. Flash forward to season 2 and Nancy apparently doesn't care about Jonathan's creepy behavior anymore and hooks up with him after leaving Steve, who's gone through a great arc and is now maybe the most likeable character on the show. How many layers of subversion and reversal is that?"
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"I absolutely despise this trope, and I hate how prevalent it is. I do think one thing you could have brought up in this video would have been about guys complaining about the “friendzone”. As if being nice to a women is supposed to make her magically reciprocate their feelings."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,And the weirdest part is that many of these movies are romance or romantic comedy. These movies are made for women as the intended audience. I guess the men who wrote those screenplays don't know or care how women actually feel about creepy stalker behavior.
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"As much as I love Stranger Things, the fact that both Nancy and Max end up with the guys that creeped up on them really rubs me the wrong way. It's one thing to show people expressing an intense amount of love, but that only works if it's mutual. Hell, that's why I love The Addams Family so much."
Best stalking movies recommend,rZ1MPc5HG_I,"When you mentioned those coercive 'grand romantic' gestures, all it made me think of was those comments on failed wedding proposal videos where the woman is called every name in the book for turning down ""a fallen brother"", how she ""was ugly anyway"" and how women can't be trusted because they're gold diggers for not wanting marriage. Yeesh."
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,1cYCbW9w0Zw,Another great philosophical film is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind! I didn't mention it because I talked about it in my last film recommendation video.
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,1cYCbW9w0Zw,Had you seen the 1997 anime film PERFECT BLUE by Satoshi Kon? That would be a great addition to your list.
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,1cYCbW9w0Zw,That was the one that Black Swan ripped off right?
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,1cYCbW9w0Zw,I think that's more of a psychological than philosophical
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,1cYCbW9w0Zw,"That's ""phycological"" movie not philosophical"
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,1cYCbW9w0Zw,Or Paprika
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,1cYCbW9w0Zw,One of my favorite movies I’ve seen recently
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,1cYCbW9w0Zw,"I just discovered your channel and I already love your taste. Prisoner of Azkaban is so unbelievably great, Cuaron did an amazing job and crreated a masterpiece."
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,1cYCbW9w0Zw,"Personally, I would have The Bucket List. It touches on every aspect of life. Love, joy, religion, faith."
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,1cYCbW9w0Zw,Silence by Michael Scorsese is also a great movie on one's struggle with Faith and suffering that I would recommend people seeing also.
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,1cYCbW9w0Zw,"I've only seen a fraction of these and all the ones I have seen I loved so I'll have to give the other ones a watch, thanks for the list!"
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,1cYCbW9w0Zw,Another good philosophical film is M directed by Fritz Lang. It tackles the psyche of a killer as well as a community’s response to crime versus the response of law enforcement
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,1cYCbW9w0Zw,"Trainspotting's inspiration on Filth is probably because they are based on books written by the same person, Irvine Welsh."
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,1cYCbW9w0Zw,Very true!
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,1cYCbW9w0Zw,Hah! I scrolled down here to make the same observation.Irvine Welsh certainly has a style.
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,1cYCbW9w0Zw,Please make a similar series on learning about psychology.
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,1cYCbW9w0Zw,"Perfect list, I'm surprised you mentioned Filth though...it's an excellent movie, though I'd rather think of it as of....bluntly said, something that pushes you into depression, but in a very interesting way...it heightens your awareness of your good position in this world at time, but also, you realise how deep down you're actually able to fall, if you only let yourself to...it reaches a certain level of scary honestly, but it's a good movie with McCavoys amazing acting performance and a point being made well👌"

movies with philosophical meaning recommend,6k80tSWsxt0,"Good stuff! Bonus points for including A Clockwork Orange! It's easy to dismiss as just violent and absurd, but not only does it ask a lot of pertinent questions you mentioned, it also created its own language!

movies with philosophical meaning recommend,6k80tSWsxt0,Three of these movies are based on ideas used in Philip K. Dick's books. Two of those three are directly adapted from PKD's Stories: Blade Runner (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep) and Minority Report. The Matrix incorporates PKD concepts of meta-realities which recurred as a major theme in a number of his books.
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,6k80tSWsxt0,Those ideas were talked about centuries earlier though. PKD was just a popular 20 century author who incorporated those ideas in his books. The ideas in the matrix were talked about extensively by Descartes (evil demon and brains in vats later) and some were even mentioned by Plato (allegory of the cave).

movies with philosophical meaning recommend,6k80tSWsxt0,"If the director of Joker has not at least read Nietzsche, he's doing it wrong."
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,6k80tSWsxt0,Love of osophy? Every book on philosophy says philosophy is  philos+sophia or the love of wisdom. A term created to distinguish itself from sophistry. Or simply the idea of a wise person. Not the love of wisdom in of itself.
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,6k80tSWsxt0,Cloud Atlas(2012) movie should be included in the list.

movies with philosophical meaning recommend,pW0UmZLUzDU,"Finally, a thoughtful and intelligent analysis of this completely unique film.  Thanks."
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,pW0UmZLUzDU,Thank you very much :)
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,pW0UmZLUzDU,"I agree with what you said at the end about how it’s more interesting to talk about than to actually watch. I like Begotten for it’s imagery, and I appreciate it for it’s artistic expression. But when it comes to actually turning it on and watching it, it’s a very boring film. Which is kind of weird because with how freaky the imagery looks, and how interesting the concept sounds (or may sound), you wouldn’t expect it to come out so boring."
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,pW0UmZLUzDU,Not me lol i I can’t get enough of it
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,pW0UmZLUzDU,"I enjoyed it the first time, but couldn’t get through a second viewing."
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,pW0UmZLUzDU,"Im glad i found a review that isn ""OoOoO so spooky. But boring."""
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,pW0UmZLUzDU,"Well there not wrong, I like thought provoking films too but this actually is boring even if it's themes & imagery are interesting"
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,pW0UmZLUzDU,"No doubt its not an easy film to watch and you basically would have to watch the film 50 times to pick out most of the various nuances contained within the ever-present shadows, layers upon layers of meaning within every body movement and every rustle of cloth... the genius of the film is its ability to tell different stories to different people and thats probably why the film hasn't been left buried in a vault somewhere."
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,pW0UmZLUzDU,Well explaining!I had an unpleasant time to understand. Thank you!
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,pW0UmZLUzDU,"I was down a rabbit hole researching the filming and processing techniques used, so this was an irrelevant tangent, but I've got a like and subscribe for anyone I come across that has a non-edge lord, correct interpretation of Nietzsche."
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,pW0UmZLUzDU,the sound design of the film is disgusting but does it job so well
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,pW0UmZLUzDU,You didn't have to blur the video because the whole movie is on youtube

movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU,"This was a really interesting, yet challenging film to tackle, and I realize the concept of making meaningful choices might still seem a bit abstract even after watching this. I was therefore hoping to gather more practical examples of making meaningful choices right here by asking all of you; what was a meaningful choice that you have made? So, if you're willing to share, I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences in the comments below!"
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU,"I think what makes a choice meaningful is embracing its vulnerability. Not making your decision based on its potential success or failure, but on a willingness to risk it even if it doesn't go the way you want it to. Examples for me where moments where I completely stepped out of my comfort zone,  ""lived the most"" instead of the ""best"" (following Camus' advice). For me these choices have all added great value. Be it from attending the university that I thought was too challenging, to travelling to new places, and even to cut ties with people that used to be friends but have simply drifted apart or were behaving in a toxic manner. Also, thank you for consistently discussing all my favorite films and reading some of my favorite books and philosophers to do so! It is always a pleasure to watch your videos."
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU,For me it's not so much about what choices I make that are meaningful in itself but to know that in every choice I make there is another that I don't make. And the meaning is attached in the faith of making a choice over all the others that I don't make that necessarily leads me into uncertainty and I comport myself into this  abyss which can only happen on faith alone.
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU,"My most meaningful choice was one that never really was one. When I left a dying woman that was the greatest love of my life it tore me apart as basically everything I've lived for died, while at the same time everything that I cold be was born again. It was insanely traumatizing, while at the same time my greatest liberation. When I met her, I knew that she was everything I ever wanted, that I wanted to stay with her until she would be gone from this world. And at the same time I began to realize that this desire was hurting her, because she was ready to leave and my love and life threatened that peace. I was what she wanted so much and at the same time the thing she could not have. She wanted me to leave, to not miss my chance for children and normality. So while we were together I could watch how the choice of us apart slowly became reality. I chose it and yet somehow I didn't, as I watched how it happened the only way it was supposed to happen. And then, in me I found everything that I saw in her, reborn from the void that I became the moment I left... I still carry her in me, now that I found the woman that she dreamt I would meet. See her reflection in every ray of sun in this world. Choices have a different... perspective for me, ever since..."
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU,I changed my career from something I thought was meaningful to a career that would help my family's lives be more secure thus giving them more opportunities to live a meaningful life.  And that gave my life meaning.  I'm quite happy with my career progression because I have a sense of purpose.
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU,"My most meaningful choice ironically enough, is one I haven't made yet... I dated this girl for a year and a half, and I know it may not seem like nothing in the great scheme of things, but it was the first time I ever fell in love, and boy did I fall... More than her in the end... The relationship got to be too much for her, and she couldn't handle it anymore so we broke it off... It kind of threw a wrench into my life, because without having made any concrete plans, and trying my damnest to take it slow, I was sort of already picturing us together, years down the line, with a little house, some dogs, some cats, possibly a goat like we loved to talk and joke about, or maybe none of that, but at least together and happy... Except now I've got none of that left. To say my whole world came crashing dow would be a bit of a dramatic exageration, but the future I had pictured and desired so deeply with her, did. And when I look at my life now, where I'm at, what I'm doing, what my options are, I'm more and more tempted each day to just Up and Go. Take the transiberian until Vladivostok, take a plane from there to Canada and see what happens. But that's my heart. My irrational, irresponsible, torn to pieces heart.My mind is telling me what about my grand parents, my whole world, who gave me so much of themselves, and who, despite their current great shape, have the looming shadow of inescapable fate hanging over heir heads like a damocles sword, ready to fall sooner rather than later ? What about my degree, that I'm so so lucky to have access to for next to no money when so many other student fight their way through crushing debts to get to where I am ? What about my friends and family whom I love so dearly ? My home that I love so much inspite of all its flaws ? What would I even do on the other side of the Atlantic, alone, with an unfinished degree ?So what do I do... How do I reconcile two contradictory voices ? How do I listen to a brain worried only about concrete mateial but essential facts ? How do I listen to a heart taken with grief and sorrow, desperate to find some solace and joy again in a stifled empty life at the expense of reason and survival ? Wouldn't that just be running away from problems that would just follow me no matter where I go ? Or would be setting myself free of the emptiness that fills me more each passing day and threatens to swallow me whole ? Heart or Mind ? Heads or Tails ? Yes or No ? I don't know... All I know is that something has to give,  lest I go insane."
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU," @Callysto  what I did, was listening to the grieving heart. What is that, that is neither suffering heart, nor worried mind? What is that, that is observing/ containing those two? I found great lasting peace in that ""..."" which all that agony is within but which is not pain, nor can it be hurt. You might know what I mean. When you find the peace, the silence in that ""..."", when that is recognized as yourself, then you can sit down and the mind goes utterly nuts, while your heart is tearing itself apart but a deep inner peace and silence will prevail. From there, listen to your heart, it sounds old and cliche but from all that I know, I can say that it does know the way. You can do it, deep down you know, remember that knowledge, trust yourself, believe in yourself, you can do it, you will do it!"
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU,"I consider a choice meaningful if the learnings of it are life changing for me and at least one more being, and now in this days I try to make decisions in order to all involves have the less damage possible, this means that not always is pretty but I think it's balance enough."
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU,"For me, meaningful choices are made when a decision flows from the confluence of character and fate. I always liked something Emerson said about ""doing broad justice where you are."" When decisions are made in this frame of mind, there doesn't seem to be any striving or ambition--no weighing of pros and cons, no real fork in the road but more of a path that feels right."

movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU,"The notion that life is a playground is profane, there are such things and right and wrong choices - those depend on your worldview, and your worldview should be informed by what you bear witness to in life. The movie is interesting and to an extend profound, but there are certain quotes and ideas presented in it that seem childish and irresponsible to me, especially if taken seriously. Its worth the watch, but if people take it too seriously they may very well end up causing more harm to themselves and the people around them, than they would if they had been none the wiser."

movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU,"Anthony Smith what path you chose will always be the right one. There is no alternative once you make a decision, because it wont ever exist. Every tiny detail lead up to every next one, so you wont ever be wrong unless you try and look back on the past and analyze it so make your choices as if your future self is already there, looking back and asking current you why."

movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU," @Anthony Smith  If I may offer some words of encouragement from one of my favorite philosophers, Alan Watts ""You can't live at all unless you live fully now""Just focus on what has to be done today and then tomorrow focus on what has to be done on that day and so on and so forth. If you become anxious about the future you will create a vicious circle and it will only hold you back from making any decision at all. Be like clouds and water because there is no such thing as a badly shaped cloud or badly formed wave. Like clouds and water they do what they are suppose to and you as well are a part of nature. No matter what you do you cant make a bad decision unless you keep thinking you do and if you decide to live your life thinking you make bad decisions then that is up to you"
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU,"@Anthony Smith hey man I know this sounds overly simplistic and even ridiculous but spend a couple of nights and really think about yourself. Just look at the sky, listen to some chill stuff and be somewhere undistracted. Then think. And as you think, try and think with your heart and mind in sync. If you were to lose everything trying something...what would be worth that risk to you ? What alternatives do you have ? Are those alternatives better, or would it be better to take a chance now ? Would it be better to do something that isn't towards your goal, but that helps you slowly reach that goal ?Oh and setting a goal is critical. Once you set a goal (that you truly truly want in your heart of hearts), everything you do should be in the direction of that goal. If you can do this, slowly and surely you will have reached your goal my dude. This worked for me. I don't know your situation, your reality or your past experiences but you follow that advice.

movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU,"One of my favorite things is the details of the movie.  look at the colors; one main timeline is yellow; yellow stands for the bright and bold, in this life he lives a bold high end life. One is blue, stands for emotion; this timeline he struggles with his and his wife’s emotions.  The final main route is red, standing for love.  In this timeline he’s in love and that’s his main motivation. Often the times the colors mix in scenes and it eludes to something changing or some major choice."

I knew i couldn't articulate it or even fully understand it at the time, but it touched me on such a deep and poignant level, and left me feeling so much and thinking so far out of the box and removed from my everyday reality... i wanted to go outside and just run barefoot through a forest, or jump high into the air and break outside of the parameters of my own body. It was liberating and incredibly depressing at the same time. I'm still trying to make sense of it all... truly an extraordinary film."

movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU,"I remember watching this movie in my teens and thinking this was going to take a while for me to figure out.  'Every choice is the right choice' never made sense to me, as a kid fresh out of high school I was uncertain of what to do. Years later, I finally realized what it meant and, more importantly, the central lesson: it is vital to make a choice even if it turns out to be the ""wrong"" one, because indecision (or inaction) is the great sin against life. ""By doing nothing you become nothing."" Great video again thank you."
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU,"The choice to live. This may seem obvious to most, but those who venture deeper into the abyss know what a hard choice this can be. Thank you for your hard work on these videos. They are deeply touching and delightfully thought-provoking. Love this movie <3""There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy.""- Albert Camus"
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU,"I am terrified of the possibility that the answer might be different for each of us. It might be no. If that is the case, and honesty within our lonely hearts would say it is, those of us barely surviving are just cowardly inflicting pain on ourselves. But, a corpse can be and actually is more painful for close ones. Luckily, depression, misanthropy and anhedonia will graciously strip you of those with enough time."
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU," @Sk3ptik0s  If we each indeed have free will within this somewhat constrained environment, then certainly the answer will be different for every individual. I agree with Hume in his essay on Suicide, that it is the human right of every person to choose whether they continue their life or not. But I do not condone the act of suicide, because the emotions of loneliness and despair are temporal experiences, no matter how long they appear to endure. To feel your life purposeless and to judge it meaningless can only occur in a deep state of suffering. Because we live in a body we will desire certain things, and when we desire we will suffer for it, and the disappointed expectations around it. But this does not mean that we should suppress our desires so we may avoid suffering, as suffering is the only state in which true personal growth of character can occur. Our development stops the moment our suffering stops. It is somehow encouraging to meet others who can graciously admit to the loneliness they feel in their hearts. This very thing somehow helps us feel less alone. As they say, misery loves company :)"
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU," @Immadi El  I have read that piece by Hume and most of what Camus wrote (""El hombre rebelde"" being my favourite). To me, the best argument for the impossibility of ""free"" will was put forth by Schopenhauer. Do you know of someone that argued succesfully for a free will, or can you defend that idea yourself? I think that when you aprehend fully the law of cause and effect you see that nothing that happens could have happened in any other way. And yet, outside of this cold rationalism I have personally documented instances where the past (and therefore the present) have changed. They call this ""The Mandela Effect"". I couldn't advance much investigating the phenomenon but I proved that at least one of the changes has residual evidence in websites and memories of unrelated persons."
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU," @Sk3ptik0s  I am a humble couch philosopher at best, so I doubt I could make an effective case for free will. But if everything is already predetermined by a cause over which our choices have absolutely no effect, then no person can be held responsible for their own thoughts, words or deeds. Then no one should be punished for doing bad things, and no one should be rewarded for doing good. Without at least some level of free will, no one ever would, or even could, accept personal responsibility for anything. I remember reading a good attempt to reconcile free will and determinism in a chapter of a book called The Limits of Evolution by a California Professor called George Holmes Howison. His philosophy was a Personalism, so whether you will find that helpful will depend on whether you fall closer to the Idealist or Materialist spectrum of philosophy. I have no personal experience of the Mandela Effect, and have found none of the proof for it too convincing, though I cannot deny the possibility of its reality. It would be a great example of a consciousness of a kind (whether individual or collective) affecting a cause, if my reasoning is sound."
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU," @Immadi El  Or perhaps is just time travel, as ""pop culture"" would propose, haha. I added this wild experience as it is relevant to the video and somewhat to the discussion, but understandbly unless someone has experienced it him/herself the healthiest response is to dismiss such lunacy, which is exactly what I would have done without being a direct witness. It seems this Howinson fella is quite old, and wrestles still with a very strong Christian presence. We are free of that influence now, free to embrace scientific nihilism... lol"
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU," @Sk3ptik0s  LOL yes it was a different time, but as some say, every new philosophy over the ages has only been an adjustment of what Plato initially laid down. Newer is not always better :) Good luck on your journey my friend, and I hope something better than scientific nihilism comes along :D"
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU," @Immadi El  I think you nailed it when you identified pessimistic existentialism with suffering. The only reason people feel life is meaningless or purposeless and wallow in questioning its value is because they are miserable/impeded, because contentment/achievement is enough to prevent existential angst most of the time. For most people, the purpose of life is simply chasing and obtaining happiness, which is basically fulfilling evolutionary imperatives, or for the odd ones something more exotic like making scientific breakthroughs or travelling. I always was considered smart in school and still will impress strangers with some talking points, but since a few years the suspicion that my life-long unhappiness heavily skews my perspective is becoming noisier. So I remain both skeptical of ""the gift of life"" (since it has been shit to me and animals survive devouring each other etc etc) and skeptical of my skepticism (because unhappy/misfit intellectuals will rationalize their failure presenting life itself as crooked). What IS true though, is that the very fact people like me exist makes questionable the prevailing idea of life being precious, since it can become torture to some. Damn, maybe we just need harsh darwinian selection back, so people that should have died don't stick around with their mutant genes..."
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU," @Sk3ptik0s  My experience of this world is very similar to your own. Some days are better than others, but on the whole this thing called Life appears highly overrated. Perhaps the problem with purpose and meaning resides in the very act of seeking purpose and meaning. Maybe we should continue carrying water and chopping wood as the Buddhists say, and then purpose and meaning will find us. But then we are likely to fail to recognize it and end up making the wrong choices anyway. The world is a shitty place because we made it so, either through our action or our inaction. And we would rather blame our fates, our gods, our ancestors, our neighbors or even nature before we will take any personal responsibility, which is the only thing which will dispel our nihilism and set the Individual as well as the collective back on course toward Eudaimonia."
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU," @Immadi El  This is silly, but chopping wood actually makes me feel good. I wish we had more trees in our garden. I can see why rustic labour was adviced by these people. Many times I fantasize about living off the land in a pristine environment. You are right, we must take responsability and put our effort into improving life, since we are not killing ourselves. A way to start is to stop supporting immoral crap through consumption. Sorry if I engaged too much, I was bored and lonely, unsurprisingly. Thanks for the heads up, hopefully I can turn things around."
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU," @Sk3ptik0s  Unfortunately these days carrying water and chopping wood means going to a job we probably hate just to sustain the life of our flesh vehicles in this broken world. I also considered joining an intentional community just to get away from it all. But in time it became clear that abandoning society and all the technological advancements we have made might not be the smartest long term move. Kind of like building a wall to keep out the Mexicans. Given enough time, any closed system will die - Science. So perhaps we should rather work at rebuilding our systems of governance and economy from the ground up - a distributed mesh of responsible persons who care for one another and the environment, instead of a centralized hub of authoritative oligarchs who care only about themselves. I don't mind engaging with a neighbor of like kind and like mind for however long they are willing, so long as Like Stories of Old doesn't mind us hijacking his comments for a nice chat :)"
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU,Mr Nobody is my favourite film and you've put my feelings into form more perfectly than I ever could.
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU,"This is my favorite movie since the day I first saw and was amazed by it. It taught my teenage self a lot about what is important in life and what small little choices can do to someones whole life.-So I would like to say:If all tiny choices matter, like saying Anna's friends are stupid or being honest about not being able to swim. And your life will drastically change after this 3 seconds, then at the same time no choice matters. If every little thing can change your life, from ordering a coffee or getting a yogurt in the store to the left then don't stress about it too much and follow your heart(feeling). Which in any case is usually the right choice.When you feel right about doing something, that is the right thing to do. Your life will shape itself around it and I hope you will encounter beautiful people to share the happiest smiles with.Look life right in the eye, smile and embrace it. Live free and share happiness.- Awesome that you covered this movie. I like your content a lot, very relaxing and mind opening."
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU,"For more on this sort of philosophy, I'd recommend reading Soren Kierkegaard, whose philosophy talks about how the infinite possibilities available to humans can fill us with existential dread. He essentially says that because there is no outside authority (such as God, which is taken on faith, not evidence) that can assure us of the 100% correct choice, we must take a leap of faith and choose something, anything, even though we may regret the infinite other roads not traveled. The only other option is ""fear and trembling."" Paralysis of the spirit.Great video as always LSOO!"
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU,"""Life can only be understood backwards, but must be lived forwards."" - KierkegaardI'm happy to see I'm not the only one who has connected his ideas to this film. You're on it my friend"

movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU,"Damn, and here I was planning to drop Kierkegaard before this. Thanks for changing that"
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU,Can I ask which book from Kierkegaard you would recommend? That addresses these topics.
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU,"However, Kierkegaard was a devout Christian, meaning that he believed God still dictated outcomes. The video is correct, every choice outcome has equal significance, but not every choice has equal happiness. Some choices ultimately end in woe and misery."
movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU, @C_Norman93 Norman  true. Choices can have negative consequences if pressent with it.

movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU,"Nestor that was beautiful. If someone could show you the alternatives to the choices that you have made would you want to see them?

movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU,The most meaningful choice I have made is to have children. Each and every one of them was a conscious choice. A choice which is at the very center of my being “life”. Bringing children into this world is not about “us” as parents or the quality of life we can provide for the children. Children will make their own choices. Creating life is about giving and letting go a part of ourselves and appreciation of the beauty of life. We must continue to choose to create life at all costs.Go ahead. Go out and make babies!!!

movies with philosophical meaning recommend,ANUunK6kiqU,"I only saw this film once (years ago) and had very mixed feelings about it; I felt frustrated by it. This video definitely provided some insightful wisdom. I understood it was about alternate timelines and had an emphasis on the nature and importance of choices (making choices or lack thereof) but while watching Mr. Nobody I was constantly trying to figure out or determine which timeline (which choices) were better (or the best). I think I realize now the point was about how each path had good things and bad things, there was not only just one ""meaningful"" or ""correct"" or ""optimal"" path. Each path was worthwhile, each different path had value and meaning despite the different outcomes and experiences. In my own life I love the idea of ""Holding life with an open hand"" Which is to say we shouldn't constantly second-guess everything we do, condemn our circumstances, or regret our decisions. Life is mysterious and unknowable, therefore we should aim to embrace the experiences of life instead of constantly overthinking everything, stressing over circumstances, or regretting our decisions all the time. Hold life with an open hand."

Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,axBsGE-C2OY,love sandra in speed...such a great film.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,axBsGE-C2OY,"Sandra and Keanu, good match !"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,axBsGE-C2OY,I loved the NET and Love potion number 9. Thank you for including them
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,axBsGE-C2OY,"Sandra Bullock can express a wide range of emotions, from haunting melancholy and loneliness, to anguish, despair, joy, delight and delicious good humour. She would be perfect as the main character in the movie of the novel, The Dandelion, the story of a wife's discovery of her husband's infidelity and her journey through grief, rage, hope and exhilaration. I hope she gets to read the novel and see how she can make it her best movie ever."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,axBsGE-C2OY,dont forget 'THE LAKE HOUSE'!!excellent movie!
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,axBsGE-C2OY,she is one of the greatest looking actresses I have ever seen  I loved her role in the bionic showdown as Kate Mason
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,axBsGE-C2OY,She can perform whether in comedy or drama!!!!
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,axBsGE-C2OY,Sandra Bullock is an Angel in disguise! I loved her in Murder by Numbers
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,axBsGE-C2OY,"while you were sleeping and speed the best among the rest, enigmatic chemistry and cinematography<3"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,axBsGE-C2OY,"miss congeniality was my favorite,she had it all together in that movie,she was funny,sexy,sweet,sassy,good girl and bad girl all in the same movie!"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,axBsGE-C2OY,"My favorites were miss congeniality, hope floats, then practical magic :P in that order. I can't believe practical magic didn't make that list."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,axBsGE-C2OY,"Speed is a very VERY ecip and entertaining movie! Whoever has not seen it, you should watch it! EPIC!!!!!"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,Sandra Bullock is my favourite movie genre 
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,To the window...
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU, @Jessica Dewey  TO THE WALL
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,Yesss HAHAHAHAH
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,they left out the massive success of The Proposal that raised her profile so high in 2009 that she was able to campaign for an Oscar for The Blind Side in 2010.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,Yeah how does that one not get  a mention. Her and Ryan were such a duo. That's one of her best comedies. ️
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,I think about it too
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,"...watched it this year for the first time - and I couldn't believe how much I laughed. That movie is a real gem, even if the RomCom genre usually ain't for you."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,Yesssss my fav romcom movie ever!!
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,It’s all the get low scene with betty for me
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,I literally just watched it and was sadly disappointed that it wasn’t mentioned
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,i came here to say the same
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,"Wow they didn't mention it! That's one of my go-to rom-coms! Such a great cast and plot, and it's hilarious. How do you hate a person at first, then you love them by the end? It's Sandra Bullock ️"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,I love that movie!
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,Yeah
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,"This woman is the whole package, she's incredibly smart, talented, funny, managed to stay humble despite her huge success, she aged like fine wine, can act in any kind of movie (comedy, drama, thriller... )... She is simply amazing! Love her!"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,And i love the scenes where she eatsIts so elegant and daintyI wish i ate like that
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,"I can't believe that Sandra is 57 years old, yet she still looks as youthful and fabulous as ever! ️"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,"Yeah, I'm like how does she and Keanu not age?"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,It’s called plastic surgery
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU," @Bipul Joshi  she hasnt had any plastic surgery. In 2019 she was asked, and denied. It could also just be an illusion, since she has such long and thick hair. Women who have such long hair could also be perceived as younger."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU, @Likony van der Poel  And you believe celebrities when they say they don't do plastic surgery?! Interesting
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,Her face is frozen with Botox. Notice her expressions are so neutral?
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU," @lara croft  yes i do lmao. and why is it even any of our business? i dont think she has gotten any, but even if she has, what does it matter?"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,she do atiny botox on her lips
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU, @Bipul Joshi  cough cough Adrenochrome
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,"@Likony van der Poel  Yeah I agree with you, who cares if she has plastic surgery as long as she doesn't look horrible some celebrities."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,"They skipped over ""The Proposal"" (2009); shame on them!! I can watch that movie 50,000 times... all the actors had such great chemistry; I can imagine what it was like filming it... watch the blooper reels!"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,Yesss it's my favorite romcom
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,And Premonition!!
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,Can't believe they left THE PROPOSAL out. It's literally my favorite movie from her!
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,I can’t believe how many movies she did back to back LIKE WOW she is truly so amazing!
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,"Right, and all very good and successful"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,This woman is TRULY ICONIC!!! Love EVERY movie she has done!
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,Sandra is one of the BEST actors in Hollywood ever! SHE understands the assignments!
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,"I love how her daughter’s favorite movie is Miss Congeniality. One of my favorites when I was a kid, and introduced it to a few girl friends during sleepovers."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,"I for one love '28 days' such an underated movie. Also partly why I like it, but mostly for its incredible story."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,Ditto
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,Love it too.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,I was like wait what... she wasn't in that zombie movie lmao... ohhh not 28 days later
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,"how can you skip the proposal, her dance scene with betty white is iconic on it self"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,"1st she should get an Oscar nomination for The Unforgivable she was amazing, 2nd we need a Miss Congeniality 3."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,Why haven't they made a sequel to While you were sleeping yet? It would be the perfect Christmas movie. Seeing all the family again and maybe the couple with their kids.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,While you were sleeping is one of my favourite films! Sadly a lot of the cast is no longer around but it’s still one of the best Christmas classics
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,Yes! Totally agreed with u.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,Sandra said no to sequels after speed 2 and MC 2 failed. It was gonna be a sequel to The Heat. But she felt like she is bad luck with sequels.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,Doesn’t have a sequel bc it’s already the perfect Christmas movie! I watch it every holiday season. “He looks like he’s… LEANING.” lol
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,"not much of ""Sandra looks back"" more like a narrator looks back... I want more of Santra talking"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,"It is amazing how diverse and versatile her credits are, I feel like whenever I'm watching her that she truly is the character. A-list actress all the way."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,Sandra deserves a nomination for The Unforgivable.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,Shes an incredible person. Love her films so much
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,"She is a legend! Her level of talent is crazy! She is equally good in action, comedy, and drama!"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,IwCpouYu3xU,"She is my favorite actress, I have seen Speed and The Proposal a thousand times. Love her and she always makes me laugh."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"I would watch anything with Sandra. She's bloody brilliant. Comedy, drama, action, thriller, romance - she kills it every time!"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,The entire cast has me excited to see this.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"I want to see her as a main villain or in a musical role(Although she said she won’t do a musical LOL) . After she completes these twos, then she will be the most versatile actress now (as she is already)"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU," @Nuttapong Phetpradub  She hates musicals, that will never happen hehe But yeah, she is amazing"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU, @Nuttapong Phetpradub  technically she voiced the villain in minions
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,I wish she did more comedy she's good
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"Yes,it is"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU, @Scott Gilliam  there's a new one coming with channing tatum next year
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU, @Khronos Kay  oh wows thank you for information 
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,and sci-fi
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"She's good, very entertaining and played her characters well in most of her movies. I still don't think she should be given Best Actress Oscar for The Blind Side."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Oh my god the scene when she said “she was only five” my heart dropped. This is incredible movie I can’t get it out of my head.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"I cannot believe how it made me cry, this was powerful"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,I cried like a baby Damn she’s a really good actress
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,DAMN YASSS! That's the ultimate scene when I bawl my eyes 
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"It's so believable and heartbreaking...she's basically howling. And Viola Davis's ""reaction"" was just stellar as well."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,I cried
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,This scene has changed the story. What a movie 
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"same ,,, i cried"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,same I cried honestly when she said that
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"I cried with my wife, that scene, only a mother would know..... I guess I'm a man with a woman's care.... if that makes any sense?"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU," @martin luckhurst  I understand that my comment is off topic and I apologize for bringing this. But we cry on movies or stories easily but we don't move or cry when innocent lives of children , women and men have been killed by the Drone attacks and bombardment done by the Military establishment of Countries. And attacks have been so brutal that we don't find bodies or statistics of number of people killed in those attacks. And this type of bombardment is still.going on in different parts of the countries. This is the Irony that we are facing in modern times."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Sandra needs to get an Oscar for this performance. She's amazing.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Yessir.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"Exactly , as well as best movie award, I didn’t even felt the time passing and the movie is 2 hrs long"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,I agree. Great movie. I think she is by far the best actress in Hollywood.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,I agree... It was so good
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Screw those OSCARS.   They are so yesteryear and fixed.  Their little awards show is an insult tothe audience.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,نعم انها تستحق الاوسكار بكل جداره  ممثله رائعة
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"Well if she can return her previous oscar for The Blind Side, she can gladly take her new one for this."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Agreed!! Please give Sandra B that Oscar   she's grown to be an absolute gem in the acting world! F**** BRILLIANT 
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Yup! She is absolutely spectacular!
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,You meen Michael Jackson should get an Oscar for his performance as a woman.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"As an older sister who also takes care of a younger sister in a toxic household where parents are absent, I am basically weeping so hard while watching this. I love my sister and if I was Ruth, I would do the same the protect her."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,except in the state of Washington children cannot be prosecuted
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,My heart goes out to you. Wishing you the best this Christmas and your sister. For your love and great sacrifice
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Just finished the movie and ur comment has me sobbing again  my whole heart goes out to both of you. I hope it gets easier 
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,I can relate to your feelings.... and I cried too like a baby....
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Hey Qamar you want to talk let it out talk to me your not alone OK.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,thank you for the spoilers
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU," so much love for you Qamar , I hope u did survive it"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Same girl same  and I watched this movie pregnant So I’m a mess 
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"I cannot believe how this movie made me have a break down,unreal I had to take to you tube and tall about it"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU, @Ridwan Kazi  That's so sweet of you to say that You're such a dear person and I don't even know you God bless you and be safe 
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Sandra didn’t even have to do anything . just looking at her felt like my insides were out and raw. She embodied someone who has suffered and experienced pain and trauma well.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU, @Sølepytt Romperusk  slow down with spice bru
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Well that is Michael Jackson playing a woman playing another woman. That takes some real tallent.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Sandra said this was the last drama she will ever make. I can’t imagine what this role took out of her as an actress. Ladies and gentlemen - this is talent on another level…GOAT status
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Facts.  status
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,YESSSIR.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Sandra doesn’t even look like Sandra. She looks like the character she’s portraying. I can already tell she put everything into this.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"She really is an excellent actor, can't wait to see this."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"That's a sign of good actor. She mostly, that's why I love her act."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Absolutely my favorite actress... Ever since while you were sleeping. Her and Julia Roberts continue to reinvent the art
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU, @Shannan Amina  She literally did that in Our Brand Is Crisis
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Looks like Sandra to me. Wanna see an actor transform into a character look at Monster
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Swear before I even watched the trailer I looked at the thumbnail and said this is about to be good as shit
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Annnd also her plastic surgeon in the last few years put his everything into. That image thumbnail literally looks like she’s wearing a mask (fitting for Halloween) but always respect her talents and path
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU, @TheWebStylist  I think a lot of digital facelifting was done in post-production as well
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,She looks exactly like Sandra Bullock though.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"This movie made me cry like a baby! One of the best movies I've ever seen, I love Sandra bullock, she never disappoints "
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,i also cried so hard after watching it!
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"Very good story line,never cried again for a movie,last time was The Notebook"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,I watched the movie twice. Cried twice :-(
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"I have so much respect for such a talented artist that is not afraid to play a ""real"" person (no makeup, stressed, tortured). I LOVE SANDRA BULLOCK!!"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,The ending broke me into tears plus her scene with Viola arguing is a blow. Sandra is so amazing. Oscar worthy.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,the little sister killed the cop
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Oh my god!!! I repeated the ending at least 5 times. So moving.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU, @ileta Marchita  You happy?!? You must be really sad to do this. 
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Nope. Generic acting
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,@GLBlackestNight let’s see you act
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,This was absolutely BRILLIANT. Sandra portrayed the character so well (as always). I found myself sobbing. Definitely a must watch
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Me thinking no one should ever watch it unless they want to cry for like 2 hours straight …. “She was only 5 years old”   Sandra is definitely one of a kind
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Dam spoilers
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"The movie was good with good acting but the story line is so stupid. Had she told the truth nothing would have happened, she would have been with her sister in a year or so when she turned 18. Horrible writing"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,i cried so hard after watching it. like literally 10 minutes of sobbing hardcore straight. cried throughout the movie too. absolutely beautiful
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU, @Dan  I’ll
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU, @Diana Monreal  osiakkkiiioio  pop ooooooziiul a o
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU, @Dan  I beg to differ… she was more like a mother to her than a sister and that’s why she took upon herself instead of having the child suffer a worst trauma … she did ask her if she knew what happened and if you saw the movie you saw that she fell and how the scene play out. Was bad writing? Or would that truly happen in such away? Personally I think it made the story more interesting.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU," @Havvlen Star  how would the trauma have been worse? Worse than not seeing the ""mother"" that raised her until then for 20 years. Not to mention she had a shotgun barrel running across her face.  Look,  I'm not saying I didn't like the movie, I just dislike lazy film writers. There isn't a detective in the world that couldn't have figured out what really happened. Additionally I stand by my opinion that had she just said what really happened, the girl is 5, there would have been no  consequences for her, so what was she ""protecting"". That script has more holes in it than that shotgun blast."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU," @Dan  agreed. Another slow burn, boring ass movie. The acting was top notch, but the writing was unrealistic, and absolute shite"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU," @Dan  I wouldn’t say that its stupid. (SPOILER) If you had a little sibling under the age of 7 that murdered someone without even realizing the gravity of the situation and they were all you had, chances are you’d take the blame too ️. I can’t speak for everyone, but in the context of the movie it’s understandable, Ruth loved Kathryn THAT much."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"This is exactly how it is in the real world. And Viola Davis ate this move up and Sandra really did put her heart into it so much that it feels real, at least to me and from a different standpoint I resonate so much with this!"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,It's Laurel Castillo and Annalise Keating lol
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU, @EJ Kram  I- ️
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,A trailer that doesn't give away the whole movie but giving just enough to wrap you into seeing it. Great cast. Definitely will be watching this.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"Gives just enough for me to remember the British TV series with exactly the same plot, after looking it up it seems it is based on it."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Netflix has been getting good at doing that. At least with the movies that are actually good.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Facts though
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,They had me at Sandra Bullock
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,They showed to much for my liking. Watch the Teaser of ‘Hellbound’ that’s what I like..
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,When will it be out
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Exactly
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU, @Dino Oldman  which series was that? I'm British but don't remember anything like that though I'm quite bias because I HATE most of our TV shows and movies lol
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU," @cammey3  Unforgiven staring Suranne Jones, it was on ITV. The ""twist"" ending is obvious."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"Wow Sandra went full methodist here with this role. She literally looks like she’s been in jail for 29 years. She looks like if michael Jackson became a woman! Good to see John Berthnal Rob Morgan & Vincent D’onofrio reprising their roles as frank castle, Turk & Wilson Fisk respectively. Might give this a watch."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"This movie is a masterpiece. But even more, Sandra her acting was epic."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,the little sister killed the cop
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU, @ileta Marchita  no shit genius
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU, @ileta Marchita  can you explain what happened?
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"If you feel like you need to release some feelings, just watch this. Makes you sob real fast. Sandra Bullock has outperformed herself."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,couldn’t stop crying
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Agreed!!! I cried the entire film!!! Sandra Bullock deserves an Oscar for this film. Beautifully tragic film.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,worst acting ever
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"It’s a well told story, as always Sandra puts everything she has into this character."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"That scene when she was yelling “she was only 5 years old”. I need someone to convince me this not real it’s only acting, absolutely impactful & amazing scene. Well done Sandra."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"I didn’t know this movie was shot in my area, I was shocked because I recognized every scene so this was extra special. Sandra is a wonderful actress, Netflix should keep doing movies with her."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Whenever Viola Davis is yelling i feel like she’s yelling at me.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,She is lol
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,The SUPREME Auntie!
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,She yelling at all of us.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Maaane that Woman is great!
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,She needs to
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU, @Bexx Genx  
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Really... How was that....
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,That’s because she is
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,and i feel grateful
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Me too
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,This movie just pulls you in from start to finish. Made me ball through the whole movie. Sandra Bullock deserves an Oscar.  Hands down one of Sandras best performances 
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"Viola needs another Oscar for the way she screamed, “YOUUUU!!! ARE NOT A VICTIM!”"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,I just watched this movie. It was incredible with unexpected twist no one saw coming. I was crying at the end. A must watch
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,One of the most powerful emotional movies I have ever watched. Incredible acting by Bullock. Stellar cast.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Don’t pass on this movie like I almost did! Never really been a fan of Sandra bullock movies but thought I’d give it a go and I’m glad I did!! One of the best movies I’ve seen in a LONG time. Definitely her best movie. It really hits you in the feels.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"This is a don't miss.  It's one of the best movies I've seen in a while, and my respect for Sandra Bullock's acting has quadrupled."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,I don't understand how critics are calling it a horrible movie. I enjoyed it
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,Bullock is such a great actress she's capable of giving Oscar worthy performances
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,OMG at the ending I couldn't stop tearing up. Sandra Bullock was believable in this character's hardship and sacrifice to her sister. A surprise to know what actually happened a two thumbs up for this movie.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"Saw the trailer tonight!  Sandra is amazing, she puts her heart and soul into all her movies.   I’ve missed her. And I’m so happy she is still going strong.  Can’t wait to see this one.  I’m sure it’s going be nominated for an award.  ️"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"just finished watching this on Netflix…it’s sooooo GOOD! As always, Sandra Bullock never disappoints, the plot twist was brilliant and unexpected."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,This movie had me sobbing the entire film! She did amazing as always. She made me feel every emotion her character played. Definitely watch
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,This movie had me weaping. Brilliant acting by Sandra Bullock.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"She dives into her roles with all the energy she has. All her characters are strong, independent and fierce females. I've been her fan since the time of Miss Congeniality and how much she has grown since then!"
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"As an older sister to 4 girls, and a mother to two girls who are 18 years apart, this movie really brought out so many emotions."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"I just watched it , and can’t express how sad and how amazing this film is , Sandra is living that role inside her when acting her role, definitely and award winner for the best film of the year ️ ️ ️ ️  ️ "
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,My older sister passed in 2019 and she reminds me of the role Sandra played. When they met in the last scene I cried so hard! If only real life were like that where you can see people again sooner.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"Incredibly powerful film! Sandra Bullock's performance is like nothing before. The entire story is captivating and moving.Viola Davis as always, did an amazing performance. Not to mention the end. You wouldn't expect it. This is a beautiful tale of love, real and unconditional love between siblings, and the willingness to sacrifice your own life for the betterment of your loved ones.A must see film! And, hopefully it will shake your soul to the core to believe to give a second chance to others. We as humanity, can and should do better for each other."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,This movie deserves an Oscar.And I wish our society is kinder and more forgiving.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,I love her so much. She has always just had that incredible charisma. No one can act like Sandra Bullock. This looks intense.
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,JNUjx7LZoiU,"Damn. Just. Damn. Wow. This movie is…I cried. Sandra’s acting broke me. It is excellent. Any movie where Sandra’s character is in a desperate, survival-type situation or just plain broken,, is an absolute must-see. Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic  can suck it for giving this a low rating. This was so good."
Best Sandra Bullocks Movies recommend,UNF90SVHGtc,"All the rolles Sandra played well.But for me the favorite role was,The lake house."

Make an Top 20 Best Sci-Fi Tv-Shows of the Century (So Far). My Favorites are The Orville, The Mandalorian & Book of Boba Fett. "
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"Wait, this millennium?  You mean they didn't know they could just stop making movies after The Matrix?"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,Ex Machina is easily my favorite
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"Vanila Sky, I am legend, I robot, Lucy, Ai, Tron legacy, Zero Theorem, Equilibrium, The Time Machine, Tomorrowland a world beyond, Ultraviolet."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"Ok, woah…time out…how the hell does Interstellar not make this list, let alone an ‘honorable’ mention…The Martian didn’t get a spot and you blow off Interstellar completely !? Come on guys, this was a massive let down to not get that on this list. Especially with movies like Spotless Mind and Darko…"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"Interstellar is!!! That movie deserves to be on the list, not just mentioned"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,I was hoping Tenet would be here.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,So far The Matrix Resurrections
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,Serenity.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"I know it would seem cheesy to have two movies by Nolan on the list, but Interstellar NEEDS to be on here."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,Absolutely
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,Agreed!
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"I think The Prestige should be here too.  If Denis Villeneuve can have two on the list, no reason Nolan can't as well."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,Interstellar is way more watchable than Children of Men.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"That’s what I was thinking. Interstellar is better than The Force Awakens in my opinion. They never said it was one movie per director, Dennis Villeneuve had 2 on the list. "
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,I thought it was number 1 
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8, @Stockman007  lol same
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8, @Jonas  nah children of men is good tier
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,yes... even tenet should get honorable mention.. kinda unfair to pick only one film per director to be on the list...
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"I don’t think its a rule…there’s two films from Alfonso Cuaron, two from Denis Villeneuve, there’s absolutely no reason for Interstellar to be left off the list"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"Edge of Tomorrow is so underrated, I'm surprised when people talk about Tom Cruise, they don't mentioned that much about Edge of Tomorrow. That's easily one of his best performance and he's surprisingly very funny in the movie"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,The ending was so satisfying aswell
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,His best film ever- it's the only Tom Cruise film I can watch over and over.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,Agree.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,Oblivion was great as well
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,His best performance is Les Grossman.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,One of the few Sci-fi movies that i like it
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,the best thing with it  tells you when you watch it the second time.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"Minority Report is the best work of Cruise, Spielberg, Philip K Dick and 21st century sci-fi... Really underrated"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8," @Yasuke the Black Samurai  I disagree. In my opinion, Magnolia is his best work. That said, Tom Cruise is a great actor, extremely professional, and very underrated.Edge of Tomorrow is one hell of a movie."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,Yeah I was disappointed it was at the bottom
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"Wow this video was a real trip down memory lane. District 9, Arrival, Edge of Tomorrow, Inception, some of my favourite movies of all time. Arrival especially was so good. We really have had a lot of top notch sci-fi over the years."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8, @nWo Wolf Pack  Not enough explosions for you? No lightsabres?
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8, @nWo Wolf Pack  It’s a sci-fi movie for adults with taste not the basic mindless crowd.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"​ @nWo Wolf Pack  You might not like it; I respect that. But don't confuse ""I didn't like the story, actors, etc."" with ""it's a bad movie."" Arrival is not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,Interstellar way ahead than all
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"Arrival is the movie which defines SciFi, and with that annihilation also mind bender, beyond imagination concept"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"Watch Movie ""Time Trap"". Its little bit different..story .... Do anyone know more movies based  time travel and sci fi adv."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8," @Itachi Uchiha  Thanks Bro, I'll Watch..."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8, @Itachi Uchiha  Can you recommend some more movies
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,What should I watch Edge of Tomorrow or Arrival ??
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"Kinda surprised about the exclusion of Interstellar, Dune, and especially Avatar."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,Yeah me too...
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"Yeah, I'd have swapped Inception for Interstellar and squeezed Dune in there too! Inception is a masterpiece, but far less ""sci-fi"" than interstellar, imo."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,ye and wtf does force awakens on the list and arrival is to highly rated
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,i mean thoes u said are all top 10+
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,Avatar is beautiful but not a great story
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8, @Frantz Cayo  agree
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8, @Frantz Cayo  I think it is a great story.  The problem is it's been told a few times already.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,Avatar isn't A Big deal But interstellar should've been in top 5 and dune in at least honorable mention
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"Avatar was visually impressive, but the story is incredibly unoriginal."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8," @Brad Smith  True, it’s a generic story but the visuals alone are incredible enough to warrant a place on the list."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,LOVE Ex Machina. It’s the first film that 1. made me realize A24 is something special 2. prompted me to cheer out loud for an Oscar VFX winner3. started our collective fascination with A.I. (and launched other projects like Westworld)4. introduced the world to Alicia Vikander 5. made dance scenes in dramas cool
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"It’s one of my favorite movies of all time, I watch it every year"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,But the ending sucked
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,Have you watched The Danish Girl movie ?
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8," @Night Light9  respect ur opinion, but many of us like how the ending really is the beginning…."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8, @@St0Ne_C0L_d  no
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8, @rhythmoriented  yepp
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8, @Night Light9  you must watch it movie for acting performance of Alicia Vikander 
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8, @@St0Ne_C0L_d  who?
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8, @Night Light9  You should watch The Danish Girl movie. That's what I am trying to say.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8, @@St0Ne_C0L_d  not interested.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,Annihilation was a fantastic sci-fi film. It really does explore the idea of self-destruction.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,I can't get that movie out of my head
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,It's my favorite film of all time. Love seeing someone else give it recognition. The music was fantastic especially in the lighthouse scene. It's a visual masterpiece and it's one of the most haunting films I've ever seen!
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8, @Sig2423  that bear scene. That damn bear scene
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,It is a poor rip off of Stalker
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8," @A Abhishek  Yeah, a very poor ripoff of Stalker. The remake of Solaris wasn't bad though."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,More of a femenism movie than a sci fi...
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8, @jubayer alam  It's a little bit of both
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"In terms of realism, The Martian is hands down the best movie. Technically still sci-fi because they use technology that doesn't exist and do things beyond our modern capabilities, but it's closer to our reality than some people realize.I think the only reason it got an ""honorable mention"" and not a top spot, is because of the fact it's grounded in our reality and not that crazy, futuristic sci-fi."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,Humans have been on mars for twenty years.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8, @Brian  if you say so.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"I was a little surprised to see the Martian not somewhere on the list. The list is top 20 right? Anyway, it doesn’t belong in the top 10."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"The exclusion of Dune, Interstellar and Avatar is absolutely mental."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,The other two I haven't watched. Dune was dull.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,Dune was a waste
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"Dune, I haven’t watched. Avatar and Interstellar should be in top 5. Well, maybe Avatar somewhere 6-10. Avatar is the #1 when it came to profoundness right after getting out of movie theater. But Avatar hasn’t aged beautifully like Interstellar has. Possible goat."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,EDGE OF TOMORROW = MASTERPIECE Should be TOP 3 easily 
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,I wholeheartedly agree top 10 film for me
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"Especially when they put A New Hope 2 ahead of it. Tthree great sci fi films that didn't even make the list : Alita: Battle Angel,  The Martian and Passengers all three are better than most of the list."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,Totally underrated!
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"Children of Men has been my favorite movie since it first came out and to this day I say it was a travesty that they released it into theaters on Christmas Day. Also, Arrival and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind had me in tears while sitting in my seat at the cinema."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,How is Interstellar not on this list?  Easily a top 3 SciFi film of all time!
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,Children of Men was an absolutely eliteeee movie. I watched it countless times as a teenager.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,Always wanted to smoke that Strawberry Cough the old man was growing 
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"that's a good one, should definitely be in the list."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,That movie is a roller coaster of emotion. I choked a bit at the baby being carried down among soldiers and rebels scene.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,The plot is really interesting.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,So glad I got to see it in the theater.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,a well deserved no. 1
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,a worthy #1
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,Inception is the definition of a MASTERPIECE. Easily one of my favorite Christopher Nolan films.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,Edge of Tomorrow should be up higher. Maybe even in the top 5. It's both thrilling and funny to watch. And it's one of Tom Cruise's best movies. And they should have Annihilation on here as well.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,I'm elated to see people give Annihilation the recognition it deserves. It's my favorite film and I show it to everyone!
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"Interstellar deserves to be on this list, would be considered one of the best movies ever when we’re looking back years later"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,Its my favorite movie. How is this possible?
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,I was ready for it to be number 1. That’s crazy it didn’t even make the list.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,Interstellar is absolutely amazing
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,It was a fantastic movie for three quarters and then in went down a black hole.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,Children of Men is one of the Greatest Movies of All Time . Period
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,such a fantastic movie. that film has some of my favorite cinematography ever.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,TBH Annihilation and Edge of Tomorrow is Underrated. The Visuals of the Annihilation is soo Creepy and yet Beautiful esp the Bear Creature that gives us Chilling Nightmares. The Performance of Tom cruise and Emily blunt is damn underrated and yet funny in the same way. This 2 films deserve more recognition
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,Thank you so much for giving Annihilation some recognition. It's my favorite film of all time. The lighthouse scene was perfect and the music haunts me to this day!
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8, @Tomas Lobo  its not a scary movie but it definitely left spooked for days. And that bear scene will never leave my thoughts. Its a curse
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"‘Inception’, one of the best science fiction movies ever made and also one of my most favorite Hollywood movies of all time.Christopher Nolan and the entire cast did an amazing job."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,P6EyjIvbex8,"Loved the list!!  With each of the top 10 I was saying ""Yup.  That's one of my favorites.""  I know it just came out, but I would've at least given Dune an honorable mention.  I think that ones gonna become a classic when it's all said and done"

good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM, @marcjtdc  what about not stealing other people's comments ? 🤔
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM," @marcjtdc  - that's a good idea, makes sense. (may try)nice reply too.  ;)....BUT, then why not delete it after watching.....logically speaking, of course ;)"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,"As someone who watched stuff like ""Back to the future, The Matrix, Inception"" etc at their time...I have got to believe that we are evolving in graphics but devolving intellectually if this list really is the best of Sci-fi of 2020. There are only 2 here I'll actually try watch for lack of alternatives."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,Give me the 2 movies
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,"Inception is forgettable, Dune is incredible."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM," @Geraint Davies  I loved both, especially the music. No wonder, its made by the same genius Hans Zimmer"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,"The crap coming out of hollywood is all full of virtual signaling and propaganda..  this is the main reason I went to foreign films and stopped my cable TV as it was all shit,  so tired of regurgitated UNoriginal  CRAP!..  and disney and WB's AT&T destroying comic book heroes ..  there are a few on this list worth watching though I have to say this is one of the better lists I have seen yet.."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,Dune with a Pink Floyd soundtrack- gave me the chills. All the CGI creators had way more time at home in lockdown perfecting their art. Not been to the cinema in 5 months- can’t wait to see every single film on this list.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,I didn't have the patience but saw the thumbnail of the Sandworm. Looked good.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,I for one am looking forward to it
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,Have you read Proxima Centauri by on amazon? This is a amazing sci fi thriller written in a way anyone can read! Google Proxima Centauri b Mike LeBlanc to find it easy
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,I saw Vivarium MONTHS ago online thru an app
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,"Hopefully we won't have to wait for cinema for Dune? The way things are going, maybe pay to stream? Such great Herbert material to work with, read the books and enjoyed the version with Picard and Sting, haha."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,todas vezes que vejo filmes apocalipticos sempre vem a mente que um dia isso vai ocorrer tenho a impressão que esses renomados diretores tem o dom da premonicão
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,"Honestly, with how big the story of Dune is, I wouldn’t mind them splitting it into 2 or 3 movies. The original Dune packed too much into one movie, it was good but very fast paced and confusing at the end!"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,"That's because the ""84"" Dune didn't do the book justice and that ending was nowhere in that book. That was the director being all stupid trying to make the story more fantasy than Sci-Fi.I think this one will be much better despite the gender changes, seems this director actually read the book. lol"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,"Eat ME ,Drink ME, excuse my lack of knowledge but which genders did they change? Also if it’s done correctly I don’t mind movies having sequels tbh"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM," @IADD  Liet Kynes has been changed from male to female which is weird if you go by the books, as the Freemen are a patriarchal society, but it's not an overall bad thing. He's probably one of the few characters you could change. I'll have to see the movie to know if it makes a difference, but I doubt it will to much."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,I would trade all those explosions and CGI for a good plot.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,What film
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,Yeah what film?
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM," @cat picton  Whatch ""Man from Earth"", literally zero exposions and CGI, one of the best sci-fi movies ever."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM, @Pedro Smith  how can you make a sci fi film without any cgi?
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM," @Pedro Smith  It's not even science fiction, it's just a movie that consists of listening to a guy tell his deep delusions, like ""I am Buddha, Jesus and Pikachu"""
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM, @Pedro Smith  ok will do
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,"Ok, Man from Earth is an EXTREME but most modern movies just rely on action and CGI with a horrible plot. I just like movies wich are more credible, interesting and well acted. I loved arrival for example, and I know many people hated it."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM, @Bob Bozo  sci fi is about concept and story telling. Not CGI. CGI is all to often used to cover up a shitty plot and a shitty story.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,"I feel like unless they really mess up, dune is gonna look fantastic with the new cgi"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM, @Kade Films Inc.  They already messed up casting Javier Bardem.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,I like how almost every sci-fi movie trailer has this epic exploding soundtrack that makes you to watch it.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,"Acting is an art form, writing a plot within a script which can hold you before a film is even made is rare, taken from a book a theme and developing it in to a film is hard but even harder is being fresh with an innovative plot, actors to portray a narrative which has pace within a beginning middle and end....Watching a film unfold is an experience of the imagination through your eyes, reading a book is more than understanding the words but using a human ability to live your own interpretation, this could be completely different from another person reading the same pages of the same book... All film making technology has lost its way in all these clips, drama sets the scene by music it should not set a reaction but enhance a situation, CGI when used less is more, effects created by actual acting and interaction between the actor's is far greater when a well written script & story line is clearly used.Silence with human emotion creates more also the camera work has a greater effect on the onlooker. I'm unsure how things will move on in the next few years but throwing huge heaps of many at making movies will and can't go on.... Spend a lot doesn't mean earn a lot and the lack of imagination within a corporate film industry will only allow new/ independent film makers a chance with lower budgets."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,Greenland was pretty good. I give it 4 out of 5 stars. I can’t imagine being one of the survivors after such an event.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,"everybody is entitled to their own opinion, but that movie suuucked"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,It sucked cause the plot sucked. half the movie was about  a kid and insulin. Like wtf
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,Greenland had so many flaws I couldn't bear to watch the entire thing. Just an awful film. Absolutely dreadful.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,I´ve never thought that Charlie would actually get a roll in Morbius. Insane.

good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,🤔🤔🤔 hmmm that's a big fact
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,"Exactly my thought! xDIf anything, if those creatures have eyes the light would likely just blind them."

Many good actors: Could be great or a desaster. But definitive I will watch it.5:16 Bloodshot- My mind its saying: look those GI efectssss! But I think the trama will be weak.  Maybe , maybe... Im still thinking.7:34 Coma - I will watch it: who can find in one movie: Matrix, Dr. Strange, Inception, and The Advengers End Game mixed in a blender??? I`m in...9:45 Tenet - Normal place with people with super power? I love fantastic reality. I hope trama can be very good.12:28 Ghostbusters Afterlife-  Sorry Mr. Rudd... I pass. Nothing interesting here.14:49 Black Widow -  As MCU fan... definitive I will.17:06 Color out of Space- I read the story... Even I love Lovecraft,  Could be strange but I dont care be dissapointed about the movie. 19:16 Morbius- Marvel again... I`m in!!!21:49 Attraction 2 (Invasion) -  it`s doesnt catch my eye... Sorry. Another Independe Day but in London...23:25 Vivarium - I watched it... love it or hate it. 24:52 Antebellum -  (That is why the Music Group chance their name...) Obviously the end will be another twist... I will watch it.26:49 The New Mutants - Marvel... again... Sure sure!!28:58 Underwater -  ??? Im not so sure... the actress, I always gave her a chance.

good Sci-Fi movies recommend,_Y1tNkzLEUM,"I  stopped this at 00:04:16, before the title ""Dune"" comes on, to say ""THANK GOD!"" It looks like Herbert's novel might FINALLY get it's due: I have read this book every few years since it came out - each time more amazed at it's subtlety, complexity, ecology-building, civilization and history-building, and the genius of its portrayal of the characters. The Dino DeLaurentis production was a failure of such massive proportions, cartoonish characters, and ridiculous plot-line I walked out half-way through it and have never seen it again, and the Sc-Fi channel's multi-episode was much better, but lacking Cinematic depth, and a budget. But this - if the preview is any indication, may be everything the previous versions were not, IF they used a four-hour format, unafraid that people would love it, or if it comes out as a series by one of the better new movie networks (Netflix, etc.), and with a James Cameron-style Director. It's nice to hope that someone STILL cares whether this masterpiece of fiction - of literature - may finally come alive on the screen."

For others its a dream you cannot wake up from, but yes it seems so real  you start to notice everything is just a little off."

good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"Is Alita a nominee? No, why?"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,Personally I think both Interstellar and Inception are overrated.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,Caseagainstfaith1.I personally loved inception but absolutely hated interstellar. I don’t understand why people go crazy over that movie.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8," @Music fan  I just couldn't swallow the premise in Inception. I just couldn't buy 10x speed per dream level idea. When they kept showing the slow-mo fall, I just facepalmed.  I liked the first half of Interstellar, but then went woo-woo."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"you forgot to mention interstellar which is already a classic,. I think you need to edit your video just to mention it,. also I don't know about mad max fury road"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,br2049 Was trash. Just a sequence of random events. I could not follow what was going on.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"WatchMojo.com 2001 AND STAR WARS 4 WAS THEEE BEST SCI FI EVER, I CANT BELIEVE YOU MENTIONED THE CRAP HERE"

good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,it is on here
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"I love how Ex Machina even exists. Beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time. It has set the tone for great contemporary Sci-fi, while proving that visual effects don't always have to be CGI."

good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,thank you
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,thanks bro
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"I agree with you about Interstellar and Moon, but Children of Men is a drop dead classic."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8, @Greg Dietz  truth. A masterpiece.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8, @Mike D  a fucking masterpiece
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,Thanx
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"Gy nowhere counter arguement: if you can include only one Nolan movie, inception is the right choice. Aside from great visual, which interstellar also has, its narrative structure and complexities far surpass Interstellar. Inception just checks more cinematic boxes"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,thanks fam
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8," @The LegendHasIt Collection  what do you telling???? INTERSTELLAR is the best Sci-Fi movie of all times!!! Inception a nice movie, nothing more. And the ranking of the video was make by a human inside of a bottle"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"I actually saw ""Edge of Tomorrow & ""The Martian"" both were actually really great! Legendary actors."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,Agreed
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,Ex Machina is a movie that deserves more recognition.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"no, it was bad"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,Indeed
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,I liked it.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"Antonella I feel like it’s gotten a lot of recognition, it even won oscars"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,It deserves recognition for making us aware of A24 - and is responsible for their first Academy Award (VFX).
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,but at least ex machina is in the list my number 1 is either arrival or ex machina
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"No, it doesn't. It's actually just a boring, heady movie with some really dumb protagonists."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8, @Caoimhín  wow good argument
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,Really? How much more bigger and popular could this already acclaimed movie get?It is an Oscar-winning movie that the critics and audiences loved.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"Arrival is a fucking amazing movie.It keeps the mystery of how aliens would look while also not keeping them out of sight constantly. It grasps the concept of ""alien technology we cannot even comprehend"" so well! It just feels like ""woah, they transcend us"". And that's what a good alien movie should make you feel.It doesn't focus on the ""quantum alien nanotech"" too much and doesn't focus on the ""human emotion""-part too much. It's juuust right. It just makes a logical scenario and feeling all the way through the movie."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,Arrival is one of my favorite movies of all time... one of the most beautifully told stories ever.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"BladeRunner2049, Interstellar, and Elysium should be considered on the list..  The Martian, Ex-Machina, and Arrival were nice picks.  I think many of the picks made were a reflection of thought experiments more so than true science fiction..especially with Inception.  I like these movies that make you think, but that's not what qualifies as science fiction nor will they then be guaranteed as classics."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,Very happy with your #1 choice but Blade Runner 2049 deserved a spot on this list. That movie is a masterpiece
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,I'm very happy that Arrival is #1. It ALMOST makes up for Minority Report and Interstellar (both masterpieces)  and Blade Runner 2049's exclusion. Almost.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"Children of Men isn't just one of the best sci-fi movies of all time, but it's one of the best movies of all time."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"Arrival is the perfect choice for number 1! It's my all-time favourite movie, not just sci-fi. As for Interstellar, it doesn't hold up so well in subsequent viewings."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"Now this is list! Well done! I love all these films! Although I would definitely put Blade Runner 2049, Gravity & absolutely Interstellar on here. My god I love Interstellar."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"I remember watching Ex-Machina a few years ago... It traumatized me because of how the robot got clever and she left him there to die. Trust goes a long way... It's a string but at some point, someone gets the idea of cutting that string. The only thing hanging on that string is your relationship to that person. Once it's cut, it falls and breaks."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,Blade Runner 2049 was amazing. Shame it didn't get an honorable mention.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"No, it seriously isn't."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8, @Saurav Kr. Lal  yes it seriously is
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,I respectfully disagree. It was terrible.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"I am so glad to see that Arrival is at the number 1 position!!! Very well deserved!! Without any doubt, one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made!!! This movie touched my soul!!! Kudos to Denis Villeneuve!! A pure master of his craft."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"I agree that Arrival was the most well received, but Blade Runner 2049 is the better one"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"""Moon"" (2009) should have at least had a spot on the list and not just an honorable mention. That movie is a undeniable genre defining sci-fi experience."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,Interstellar is not everyone's cup of tea...Though it's one of the best space sci fi movie..
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,absolutely true
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,It’s not my cup of tea but I do recognize that it’s one of the best
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"Just watched Interstellar today. I can say that Interstellar is the best space sci-fi film ever. Though I haven't seen any aside from it, Interstellar definitely set the standard for space sci-fi films. The story, animation and acting is impeccable."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,Lol its fucking simple
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"It isn't. It's too scientifically inaccurate to be called a ""'sci"" fi. People who don't understand shit about science say that they like the movie in order to sound cooler"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8, @Prithbiraj Bhattacharjee  dafuq r u saying people who understand science also like it
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8, @Ahmed Hossam  Lol check again. They don't. It's too much BS.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,It's the same way I feel about 2001: A Space Odyssey. Not everyone's cup of tea but is still a solid classic.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8," @Prithbiraj Bhattacharjee  its sci FI like in fiction, ofc its not gonna be accurate cause ppl dont like accurate they like explosions and some total inaccurate interpretations of black holes and space time. If you want some accurate videos than watch some science discussions and presentations and speeches, dont watch a fictional movie for that."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,The best by far..
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,District 9 was amazing! And it happened in my home country. I also LOVED INTERSTELLAR!
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"Every movie mentioned is amazing, but Interstellar should definitely be Top 5, And I think they should’ve waited long enough to include Ad Astra, as I suspect it will be that good. Also I think Moon is good enough to make the list. And no BR 2049? Wow. Also Snowpiercer was amazing and original and deserved a mention."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"I've seen every movie on this list. This is the first time in the history of WatchMojo videos. :DMy personal favourite is Ex Machina. And yeah, I also miss Blade Runner 2049, it should be there instead of Edge of Tomorrow."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,Great list Watchmojo loved it. Sci fi is my favorite genre and ESOTSM is my favorite movie.That scene in Her after she is offline and he panicked and then found out how many people she was talking to and how many people she was in love with was so heartbreaking.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,I knew Arrival was gonna be no 1. It's timeless. Another beautiful film I think should've been worth mentioning; Snowpiercer
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,I loved the movie upgrade. The ending is so great.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,I have watched Arrival at least 5 times and just watched it about an hour ago and have been trying to find other movies like it. I LOVE this movie so much
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,Best scifi film of the decade BR2049. A definite classic masterpiece.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"This is the best Sci fi movie list I've ever seen.I've seen all the movies mentioned in the video, and trust me all of them are true gems"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,This is a great list. Arrival and District 9 are my all time favourite alien movies.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,Moon absolutely belongs on this list. So does Coherence and Banshee Chapter.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"I like INTERSTELLAR and the honorable mention of GRAVITY. I also love EDGE OF TOMORROW, MINORITY REPORT, and THE MARTIAN!"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,There's also some sci-fi flicks that you forgot to mention....- Snowpiercer (2013)- Pandorum (2009)- Upgrade (2018)- Blade Runner 2049 (2017)- Sunshine (2007)- Elysium (2013)- WALL-E (2008)
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"Inception, District 9, Children of Men, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind are hardly modern at this point and all 4 of them are already big classics. There are several very good movies not on this list but since endless very good sci-fi movies came out this decade, it is understandable."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"You don't make a best sci-fi list without Interstellar, Watchmojo."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,I loved annilation and wish they have more movies like that
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,Still can't forget Ex Machina. It is so beautiful and also so thought provoking
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"Of course ""Blade Runner 2049"", ""Interstella"", and I want to add ""I am Mother"", quite underated movie."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"Wall-E should've been here, unless you're planning to make a Top 10 Animated movies that will become future classics, which you should definitely do."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,YyyEADhvlJ8,"Brilliant list,Arrival had to be number one,definitely in my top 100 movies of all time"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Kinda sad neither Upstream Color nor Primer made the cut, but I can understand why. Great list as always!"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Shammy Primer was at least shown in the clips. I haven't heard about Upstream Color, though. Will look it up :)"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Pretty good films, but not quite as important for history yet as the ones that made the cut, though."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"True. Primer may eventually become a keystone film for Shane Carruth, if he goes on to make a real successful and classic film..a sort of reference to say 'we know he had the potential to be a great film maker when we saw this', but until that happens, you're correct."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,They're both great films - you're right - but there's no way they're going to list a couple of left-field movies on a popular site like this.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,it isn't a case that they are left field. Upsteam colour is kinda tosh! I watched it once and I have no real urge to watch it again. Primer is constantly fascinating though.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"If you liked Primer (which I did), check out Travelling Salesman. It's basically 5 guys sitting around a table arguing about ethics and mathematics... but it's pure science fiction."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Though one of my favorites as well Primer is not the most accessible film, which is why I think they left it off the list. Considering you have to see it 15 times to have even an inkling of what’s going on... There were actually no time travel movies, which was disappointing."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Am I crazy for not liking primer, do I need to rewatch it?"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,Not sure I would call Upstream Color SciFi.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc, @Paul Dalh  A clip from Upstream Color is shown at around 6:30.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,2001 being made before we even landed on the moon is frankly brain boggling - a truly timeless classic with effects that stand up 50 years later
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,The short story 'Sentential' it was derived from dates back another decade.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Cue the conspiracy theorists. ""We neVER LAnDeD On tHE MOoN!!!1!1!1!"""""
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,yea and Stanley Kubrick obviously directed the moon landing
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Fun fact. Apollo 8 was the first mission to go to Farside. There was apparently a great temptation and discussion among the crew to report the sighting of a large, black monolith on the farside of the Moon. These men didn't just have balls of Titanium, they had a sense of humour too."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,2001 is simply ONE OF THE GREATEST FILMS of all time! Brilliant exploration of the evolution of humanity and for those who find it boring: A KIRK CAMERON MOVIE MIGHT BE MORE YOUR SPEED!
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc, @Mark Hodges  The monkey scenes at the start is by far the greatest set of scenes ever out on celluloid.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Nah effects are shit, and do Not stand ip 50 years later, but it sure is impressive for its time. Just don’t think its ""so good its like it was made today"""
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,They didn’t and both were Kubrick productions.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,O
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Matrix and Interstellar were iconic science fiction pieces, eyes openers. I'm glad Contact is included, it marked my childhood."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,Yeah but interstellar is a lot like 2001: space odyssey. Some say interstellar is an original even though it is based off of 2001: a space odyssey. The director of Interstellar Christopher Nolan’s favourite film is 2001: a space odyssey. 2001: a space odyssey is the original
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"The great thing about sci-fi is, it's so endlessly interesting it works in all genres - you could do the top ten sci-fi comedies (eg. Galaxy Quest and Ghostbusters); sci-fi war movies (Edge of Tomorrow), sci-fi romances (Starman), sci-fi thrillers (Predestination) ... it never ends! I enjoyed your list, glad you included Contact and Spotless Mind - great pics. And agree, 2001 still hasn't been beaten."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"People just dont have the sense for quality anymore, so quality basically starts to cease-to-matter, which is sad af."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"""Stalker"" is really stunning. Tarkovsky is a visual poet. My all time fav is Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"" though."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"I finally did watch Brazil just last week. Lets just say that if an actor or an actress wants to be remembered for that movie, i try to be courteous and not remind anyone. or imdb"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc, @TyfoiD75  why is it baD ?xD
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc, @Major Mononoke   it is just one of those movies that focus on being absurd and try to be cool like clockwork orange
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,Be careful of the ductwork.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc," @TyfoiD75  ummmm, clockwork orange is incredible, Brazil is crap, I'm gonna get hated for that but it's my opinion "
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Tarkvosky is so overrated, none of his films are nowhere near top 10"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,Brazil is my all time favorite as well.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Not my all-time favorite, but up there- just so brilliant and relevant. Gilliam's masterpiece IMO. And one of the best films of the 80s."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc," @The Teentonist   yeah tbh it was very boring watching stalker, the entire film is 150 minutes of building subtext but it feels like it took 10 times longer to build the amount of subtext than it needed to for maybe 10 minutes of good movie and the rest is tiresome"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc," @jack steel  it’s good, but y’know, it’s vastly overrated. It’s far too distant emotionally (to me atleast) and feels a bit pretentious even, although Tarkovsky’s genius still shines."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"#2 on list, 'Stalker' (1979) is a beautiful film. Very simple to nearly no FX, and it's mesmerizing!"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"I loved ""Her"" but I'd still have to go with Blade Runner in that category as no film has ever perfectly exemplified the Uncanny Valley hypothesis."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"While I prefer Her, your comment is the only one that defends Blade Runner is a constructive way, unlike all these fucking fanboys."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Her is embarrassingly over-rated, imo.  It being even mentioned on this list calls into question its credibility."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Honestly, science fiction is such a huge genre with different ideas and ways to explore those. Top 10 is cutting it too short. Top 50 would still leave too many movies out side. And thus undiscovered by newbies."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"But, it would let in some of the Star Wars and Star Trek movies! 8-O"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"""Contact"" the book magnificently goes into what these people point out in this piece referring to the movie.  It's really very interesting.  The movie only hits certain points, as it is just a movie.Similarly, I strongly recommend reading the book ""2001.""  I thought the movie kind of pretty but incomprehensible when I first saw it as a 14-year-old. I read the novel two  years later, and now I can't get enough of the movie."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,totally agree with number 1 - i saw it in the cinema as a kid and it was closest to being in space and leaving earth behind - it was a vast film to watch
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,I like all the films mentioned for each of their own merit.  I wish there was more time travel/ causality themes in the mix.  Not Timecop or back to the future  but One of my favs is Predestination.Or even Millennium.Where time travel is just a mechanism used but not as a plot device.Netflix series Travelers is perfect example.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Time travel is not done logically very often. 12 Monkeys did it pretty well, until the very end. Dark on Netflix is also pretty good, although the method of time travel is pretty vague."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,Great list. I might have added 'Predestination' for the time travel part that should be included in a list like this.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Children of men was insanely powerful, memorable and heartbreaking film! Beautifully done !"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"I always found Jodie Foster's stupified "" I had no idea! "" in 'Contact' to be revelatory. I started my love affair with sci-fi as a child through reading Verne and Clarke and Asimov. Later on graduating to Heinlein and Herbert and Bradbury. I would agree with the #1 pick of 2001, simply because it encapsulates humanity and its goals so well. It is a visual tone poem to the past, present and future of the species. A seminal work of wonderment for all."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"I completely agree that #1 is ""2001 a Space Odyssey."" A masterpiece of direction, score, and visuals. A cerebral journey into the past/present/future that asks the questions... ""Who are we"", Where did we come from"", Where are we going."" The film allows for endless interpretations and continuous debate serving as the ultimate allegorical backdrop to the answers."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Leaving out ""Blade Runner"" was basically criminal.Ditto for ""Alien."""
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"BR = incoherent artsy mish-mosh. Alien = horror movie masquerading as science fiction. Perhaps you’d like to nominate G.I. Jane or Kingdom of Heaven as deathless masterworks? Have you even SEEN The Duelists, Scott’s one bona fide masterpiece?"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Fully agree, blade runner is essential"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc, @PinkOld  he has a point though. which Film you would take it over in that list?
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,They mantioned it
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc, @Luis Sierra  Still didn't make it onto the list.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc," @Robert Gaj  Except ""Blade Runner"" failed at the box office, only achieving its near mythic status in the years since its original release, once people and critics alike were able to recognize its greatness, much as happened with ""The Thing.""You don't know what you're talking about."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc," @PinkOld  All those words to tell me it's popular NOW and has a near mythic status in the present day. So basically you just proved me right, I never said anything about how it was perceived during release"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc," @PinkOld  Funny how some people just make up random things about other people when an argument is not going there way. Alien and Blade Runner are both fantastic films, but if you look at the way Cinefix makes their lists with the categories it is not necessary for them to be in this particular top 10 imo. That's all I wanted to say, no need to try to label me in some kind of weird box you just made up."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Saw 2001 aged seven and HAL scared me badly.I could sense the psycho within the machine.Never understood the ending, though, until I read the book, years later. His numerous stories, both short and novels, based on sound science, were terrific and the two Voyagers were to prove some of his theories correct. RIP, Arthur!Excellent choice for #1 position!"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Children of Men was an awesome film, complete surprise to see it, had no expectations at all. Shattering film."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,“Cease firing!”  Good god...
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"The prestige is such a good movie that when I ask people, almost no one has seen it and it’s surprising. Such a great movie with a great payoff"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,Even re watching it knowing the twist and it still holds up. I was stoked to see it listed here too. Brilliant movie.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,Almighty Sosa300 - but it is not a true science fiction movie (same for Her).
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"The prestige is probably the most popular of the entire list and the honorable mentions.... Besides maybe ""arrival , or Interstellar"""
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"The Prestige has been one of my favorite sci-fi films since seeing it in theaters, and every re-watch of it still makes my skin crawl. Brilliantly explores its themes, total masterpiece."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,I don’t get it? There is no twist in the prestige. It is obvious what is going on. Why do people love it? Everyone forgets Hugh Jackman’s character was just a dilettante until one of Bale’s characters killed his wife. His ‘trick’ cost Jackman’s character his wife. He gets a pass for everything from me after that point.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,Michael Mitchell the twist is that bales character has been 2 people the entire movie and upon rewatching it is very subtle as hard to catch which is why I like it so much
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Almighty Sosa300 I thought it was obvious he was a twin. If you do a trick that there is only one way it can be done, then it is obvious how you did it. He left no doubt."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc," @John Smith  no Blade Runner, Alien ET, Close Encounters, 2001 are more popular."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc," @Donald Dude  those are more popular with film fans, but normies know of the prestige more because it's a Nolan movie, and Nolan is for normies"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"I have never seen the film, but I have seen clips and frankly, it's not on my to watch list."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"I made a list of 10 in no particular order except for 2001 A Space Odyssey which is number 1 for me.This list is based of of the movies I re-watch the most often.2001 A Space Odyssey,Star Trek the Motion Picture(this will be controversial but it's a brilliant, slow moving, cerebral film in my opinion. It's also an emotional reunion of the cast 10 years after the series ended.)AlienSoylent GreenThe Thing from Another World (1951)The Thing (1982),Planet of the Apes(1968), Solaris (Andrei Tarkovsky), Godzilla (original Japanese version), Invasion of the Body Snatchers(1978)A couple worth watching not on my list because I could not fit them:All Summer in a Day (30 minute adaption of the Ray Bradbury short story. The entire short film is on youtube)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV-rzGx21rwFantastic Planet (animated)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IscoJBAv4vs"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"For those interested in watching Stalker: after you watch it, read the book it's made by (Arkady and Boris Strugatsky - Side Road Picnic). The book is much more dramatic. This is what I like in Strugatsky sci-fi, the main event of their books remains human being. People get to the greatest technologies of all times, Earth is visited, humans become so high developed that are visiting other civilizations in space and help them to develope, but in the same time humans are humans... The visit on Earth gets a routine, greatest technologies instead of making people happier got them bored and unhappy; the project of helping to develope other civilizations gets out of control because of humans emotions... Sounds so usual and pathetic but when you realize that some of their books are written in far 1965 you get amazed of their feel of the future and prophetic stories!"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Unexpectedly excellent commentary! Your intelligence shines thru not only in your picks, but in your insightful analysis. Bravo!"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Could have a thousand people, each with their own list and they'd all be different. I enjoyed your list and especially liked how you included honorable mentions throughout. Great job!"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Cool collection. And big thanks for putting such a demanding arthouse (and Soviet!) scifi-film as Stalker on #2 - maybe Tarkowsky's other SciFi film ""Solaris"" would have been adequate here. What I missed a little were comedies and satires as Idiocracy(2006), Demolition Man (1993), Sleeper (1973) - all dealing with someone from the present somehow ending up in the future."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Must have been difficult to settle on just 10 categories. There are so, so many others in the sci-fi genre that this could be a multiple part series. There's Steam Punk sci-fi (Prestige, 20000 leagues, and Frankenstein fit here), Travel sci-fi (Journey to the Center of the Earth and Fantastic Voyage), Time Travel (Looper, Primer, BttF). Near future, far future, alternate history, alien world. Seriously, it can go on."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"In my opinion had to include Bladerunner which has had a massive impact on cyberpunk movies like Strange Days and the incredible 1995 anime Ghost in the Shell, without which blockbusters like The Matrix would not exist."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Happy to see Children Of Men and The Prestige get some recognition. Two of my recent favorites. I think Children Of Men could be like Blade Runner, largely ignored initially, but later viewed as one of the greats."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"When I read the book 2001 A Space Odyssey, I didn't realise it was published after the film was released. I later found out the story was developed by both Kubrick and Clark, although Clark ended up as the official author."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"It's a good thing you had 2001 at number one. Even after 50 years it still holds up. Whilst some may consider it lazy writing to make things vague, it's part of the magic that makes this film so great."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,I was a kid when my dad (a film booker) took me to see '2001 A Space Oddesy' before it came out. The screen was the largest in the world at that time and it curved on both ends. The movie blew me away and I've been a Sci-fi fan ever since then.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,50 years later and 2001 is still a stunning film.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Great list guys! Sure, you left some of my favorite sci-fi movies out but, is a great list anyway. Love sci-fi, probably my favorite genre of movies."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Some of these, I haven’t watched it & now I want to watch all the films you’ve shown in this video, whether they were on the Top 10 List or not. Can you make a List of all the films you showed?"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"2001: A Space Odyssey used to be my favourite film of all time until I saw Blade Runner 2049.  The sheer beauty of the spinners flying through rain as though in a Turner painting, the lighting in the executive level of the Tyrell Corporation unseen by a blind CEO, the astonishing tenderness and humanity of a hologram who loves a replicant, the astonishingly cruel inhumanity of the Tyrell Corporation CEO who barbarously slaughters his sentient  creations, and the transcendent hope that artificial people capable of love may supplant a dying humanity."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,I didn’t expect to see Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind in this list and even at the top 3. I really love that movie and its ending made me cry so bad.
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"I found it wonderful to see ""Metropolis"" on your list. A great film way before it's time."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Interstellar, Blade Runner and Matrix should be on the list!"
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"I saw 2001: A Space Odyssey on a School Outing I think in 1969, I would have been 6 years old, enjoyed it but didn't understand it.  Watching it later on in life, I enjoy it a lot more and can get to grips with what is going on.  I like playing Elite Dangerous on the PC as when ever you dock the ship, the Blue Danube plays as a nod to the film, a beautiful piece of music that reminds me of that film."
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,Finally giving The Prestige the recognition it deserves
good Sci-Fi movies recommend,C8xAuN_nHNc,"Ahh, Contact, my favourite all time movie. Every time I get to the scene with John Hurt, ""They still want an American to go. Wanna take a ride?"". That gets me, brings a tear to my eye and makes me feel an adrenaline rush like no other."

movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,MsMojo should’ve had Dreamboy
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Mace runner 3 end is sad but one? No way
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Okay so with Fault in our stars. The ending is sad yes that she is left without him. But that is not the end of the story that is just where the author decided to end the book. Hazel is based off of a person in real life. And the person she is based off in real life would die one year later leaving them dead together. So is it sad yes. But the ending is not about it being sad. It is about moving on and living each moment as it your last.
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,I feel like Bridge to Terabithia scarred a whole generation of kids who were taken to the cinema by their parents thinking it's a fun exciting adventure film.
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"Brilliant Chaos we were drug to a live action play on a field trip! I don’t remember 99% of my field trips, but I remember that one! "
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,NO. I can’t with this movie 
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM, @Kate Kincaid  to be honest that sounds so nostalgic and sweet to me.
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"Nah I read the book “Bridge to Terabithia”  before my parents attempted to take me to that dark place. They also couldn’t wreck me with Perks of a wallflower, Fault in our stars, I already knew about Romeo and Juliet, oh and the movie “Lovely Bones” my mom wanted to attempt and pull a fast one me and take me to the movies ... I had already read the book too. If it’s a movie and a teen story  or sad in any way or romancey or its going to be turned into a film I always read the book before seeing the movie because I don’t cry in public. I refuse"
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"I remember when it released on Disney channel - it inspired two things, my fear of losing my friends, of dying by hitting my head and my attempt at drawing what Jess drew in the movie"
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Our schoolteachers here in sweden thought it would be fun to take both classes to watch it in the cinema. I still remember that scene when he ran away and cried
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM," @Ya gurl  When I was younger every month our local cinema had a ""kids day"" where they would pick a movie to show at a very discounted price for children. One month they picked Bridge to Terabithia. Mistakes were made."
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"Brilliant Chaos   I think so too!  As a teacher, I was supposed to read this book with my 4th grade class.  Just thinking about it made me cry and I had to find a substitute."
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,People really should have known the book was about before seeing the film. Disney did a bad job advertising it making it seem like it was fluff and fun and not a melancholy movie about loss.
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,I did not register anything else from that movie after she die. Childhood me was shook.
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Omg Five Feet Apart was the hardest for me the ending left me in tears like every time

movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Hedwig’s death was sad as well. But no one can beat Dobby.
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,If Juliet had just opened her freaking mouth Romeo wouldn’t have died lol
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Tragic
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"Literally most of his deaths in movies are so preventable, same as in the titanic, if rose went on one of the rescue boats or jack got his own piece of wood he wouldn’t have died lmao"
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Yeah that’s one of the only reasons I didn’t cry
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Luna Limon Exactly. The wood would have fit the two of them even!!
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"Likewise, I remember watching the 1996 version in class, and we were all practically screaming at Juliet to let Romeo know that she was alive immediately, instead of just lying there and looking at him longingly right as he poisoned himself!"
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"Yeah, that's why the story is so frustrating "
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Luna Limon exactly if he got onto the piece of wood with rose he wouldn’t have died
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM," @Wendy Rojas  He actually still would have, because even if the wood was big enough to hold them both, their combined body weight on it would mean that eventually it would've sunk and they both end up dying, so no matter how you look at it, someone was gonna die, and the only solution was for Jack to find a second piece of wood to hold on to"
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"PrinceTrexus I know! It’s not like she didn’t know what he was doing, she was watching it happen"
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Agreed she just was staring at him

movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Amen
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Ive watched this movie so many times and cry everytime
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM, @Jessie Black  that one was not love story. And we are talking about sad not depressing.
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM," @You are right But  pretty sure the title of the video is teen movies, not love stories. Also sorry if I ruined the conversation."
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Without any doubt
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM, @Jessie Black  well in that case yes that movie was depressing because it was something that happened in real may be the story was fictional but still I was not sad for Bruno but for all who died without any reason.

movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Five feet apart...When she said ‘close your eyes because I don’t think I can walk away with you looking.’ Or whatever it was. I cried. So hard.

movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,At my old school my teacher was reading Where the Red Fern Grows and she was walking around handing tissues to people who needed them because everyone was crying

movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,I cried half through the fault in our Stars. I was sobbing so loud in the movie theater that I swore never to watch those kind of movies in public again. And the scene that puts me to tears everytime in a walk to remember is when Landon breaks out in tears in front of his father and tells him that his girlfriend is dying.

movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,I just saw Dead Poets Society and I feel it should DEFINITELY be here
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,The Perks of Being a Wall Flower is the only show/movie that I've seen that accurately portrays what a suicide attempt is like. It's incredibly similar to my own. Which is why it is number 1 on my list.
movies like lost recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"I never knew why Cmbyn was such an emotional ending until I realised that Elio was just a project for Oliver. While Elio was in love for the first time Oliver just thought of a nice interesting project with Elio. Oliver moved on, forgot about his short summer romance and got married. Elio couldn't let go and still loves his first lover. This is what heartbreak feels like"

movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"If you never seen the “Before” Trilogy, I highly recommend that you don’t watch all three all at one time. Watch Before Sunrise then wait about a year then watch Before Sunset. Wait about 3 years to watch Before Midnight. Give yourself time to imagine what you think happened after each film. That’s the best thing about this series."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"Okay, thank you.  I really wanted to see them after this list but I'll space em out."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"Haha, I never thought about it that way but you have a great point. I Watched Before Sunrise at like midnight and forced myself to stay up because I had to watch Sunset immediately afterwards, for obvious reasons. Didn't watch Midnight until a couple of months later, and now that you say it, it definitely does make sense to have some breathing room before each one."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,You are absolutely right. Me and my ex did just that. And it's amazing how long those movies stayed with us. It was like watching your story.
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"Funny thing, I happen to watch ""Before Sunset"" by chance without knowing it's part of a trilogy. Then, later discovered the trilogy and watched them all coz I liked it so much!"
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,They were all made exactly 9 years apart. Also in the movies it’s 9 years after each film. I waited 9 years after each movie! The years of thinking about what happened to them captivated me. I kinda wish I never seen Before Midnight. I would’ve loved to live rest of my life not truly knowing what happened to them after the second film.
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Too late. 😅
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,that's what I did :)
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"Agreed. Poor thing if you haven't seen them but you are also in for a treat.I saw ""Before Sunrise"" about 10 years after it came out. Caught it a quarter way throughand it stuck with me. Didn't find out about ""Sunset"" unitl about 4 years later and awaitedthe release of ""Midnight"" since. I love the trilogy dearly it almost hurts on how real it feels.Would recommend highly to to any fan of the genre."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"I watched each movie as it came out over the 18-year period. ""Sunset"" is my favourite. ""Midnight"" is a difficult one to get through, but really good and do necessary in documenting how time affects love, and how love (albeit in different ways) survives time."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Before trilogy is the best romance.Beside the dialogue & natural chemistry of julie and ethan.the real timeline and personality is enchating.
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"""500 Days of Summer"" is the best! I love how the key plot point isn't about Tom getting Summer, but rather trying to get OVER her and to move on with his life, which very few romantic movies do."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Have not seen it. On my WATCH LIST.
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,And also how he comes to realise that he was deluding himself and attaching unfair expectations onto Summer.
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"+KellyKSM1974 I totally agree!😃 I loved both movies, and adored how ""Definitely Maybe"" avoided making any of the main characters villains, and showed them all to be complex individuals who are searching for their own happiness. We need more realistic chick flicks out there, where love doesn't always conquer all. ""The Midnight Trilogy"" and ""Blue Valentine"" both did a brilliant job of showing how love can either mature or fade over time, and how it effects everyone involved.💔"
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg," @KellyRyan  wow, 'Definitely, Maybe"" was my favourite too. It was also something different than the usual romantic movies."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,I still remember it. who knew life sometimes gets like that
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"But then again it has a fatal yet totally realistic flaw:she apparently had a fiance while dating Tom(never saw the movie which I have to question its details),so my question is if she already was engaged to someone else then how does she let Tom into her life?That's the problem:you don't have a relationship with someone just cause you want one!You have one if you intend to marry that person!"
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Can't believe The Notebook and Crazy Stupid Love is not here.
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Brilliant
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"Trina Q  My thought exactly!!Of all the 10 movies shown here, that’s the only one I have on DVD.  GREAT Movie!!  I’m surprised that they didn’t  mentioned “The Vow”, which is another great movie."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg, @DaFilmQueen  that was after they broke up.
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,There should be a serious distinction between romance movies and relationship movies.
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Great point ;-)
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,And why is that? Because you want a fake cliche version of each when neither are realistic? Having a romance story void of relationship issues is a farce.
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Both of those facets of life are extremely complex and intertwined
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,ohh very great poitn .
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,That is precisely the way I distinguish them.
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,ironic
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,wow
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,What's the difference?
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg," @Aurora  Relationship movies can be more realistic where one of the partner can be the *bad guy/girl (like 500 Days of Summer), but romance movies can be devoid of realism altogether where the audience would favor both lovers to get together in the end."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Point!
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,I was hoping Eternal Sunshine would be on here. The emotions are so realistic
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,umm it is
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,gleebah I know. I meant I’m glad they didn’t disappoint.
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"Lori Hansen ughhh I KNOW! I meant I was glad they put it on the list. It’s like when you say  “Hey! I was hoping you would show up.” to a friend who comes to your party. I was hoping they’d put it on the list before I watched it and they didn’t disappoint,  that’s what I meant...."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"I understood,  HowCaseySeesIt  . If I hadn't, though, I still probably wouldn't call you names!"

movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"Am I the only one who thinks that Lost In Translation is not so much of a love story, but more of a friendship story? Sometimes friendly relationships can acquire similar tones of the romantic relationships."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,That's what I said to a friend of mine!  I agree with you!
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Totally agree
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,That’s a good observation.
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,The best friendships are love stories. You just aren't in love with them.
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,It is definitely more of a friendship story
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"I’m so glad you pointed that out, I was thinking the exact same thing. Also I think they missed the point a bit about being in an unfamiliar culture and city and how disorientating that can be. I felt that, that was kind of the basis of the friendship, that the familiarity of the other person outweighed the differences and served as a bridge towards the friendship. I don’t know I might be overthinking it."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"Yep I was thinking that too, although I like the analysis and the commentary on melancholy"
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,I think even Charlotte and Bob didn't know if they were in love or in friendship
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"I think there´s friendship and some romantic feelings, maybe even some kind of love."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,The “Before” Trilogy is flat out the most honest portrayal of a relationship you will ever see in a movie.
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"I don't understand why I always see people (not in this comment section) depicting Summer as the bad girl in the movie, it's like I always have to explain to them that she never promised anything to Tom and he kept ignoring that and idealizing her all the time"
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,IKR!! THANK YOU!!!
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"Yes!!! I love JGL and was sad he was heartbroken in the movie, but he was told the truth since the beginning!"
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"People like Summer are actually the worst, they really say that don't want anything serious, I will give you that, but the attitudes say other things completely different and when things end, the other person blames himself because we should have ""listened"". If you don't want to be in a relationship also act like it."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"Final Incept I agree with this but abduction is almost never woven as a normal take on a relationship.Beauty and the Beast is one example, but that trope hardly ever shows up in romance movies, unless you read those weird dark “romance” novel, and those deal with that most extreme scenarios.The other ones, definitely yes."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg," @xTLtokio  She didn't promise him anything though...and kept telling him she didn't want it, she was enjoying the sex but didn't wanna go beyond that."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"This is what JGL had to say about his character 'The (500) Days Of Summer attitude of ‘He wants you so bad’ seems attractive to some women and men, especially younger ones. But I would encourage anyone who has a crush on my character to watch it again and examine how selfish he is. He develops a mildly delusional obsession over a girl onto whom he projects all these fantasies. He thinks she’ll give his life meaning because he doesn’t care about much else going on in his life. A lot of boys and girls think their lives will have meaning if they find a partner who wants nothing else in life but them. That’s not healthy. That’s falling in love with the idea of a person, not the actual person.'"
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"xTLtokio Bingo. You hit the nail right on the head. Yes, Levitt should have known better and read the signs better, but she played with his emotions the entire movie. Becoming embroiled in a serious relationship with someone who worships you and you really don't give a damn is not 'being honest', as many commenters here seem to think."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"Thalice sorry, but your statements show a callous disregard for the emotions of others. What is also not healthy is having a 'buyer beware' attitude towards people who have developed attachments to us. If warning someone that you are not into them like they are into you, then using their attachment to you for your own gain seems normal to you, then yes, I consider that a callous disregard for the emotions of others. Perhaps you see a little Summer in the way you treat others and defend this behavior accordingly. Being honest does not give carte blanche to treat people as playthings, which is exactly what Summer does."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"The person who wrote the script and everyone involved in the making of the film have a different perspective than you do. By the way, 'worshipping' someone is incredibly unhealthy, both for you and for them. Not being emotionally dependent doesn't make you a sociopath, it makes you a more balanced human being. I don't see a little Summer in me either. I see a lot of Levitt's character in the way I used to behave, and all it did was make me and everyone around me unhappy. The all or nothing perspective to romantic relationships of it's either you're 'hopelessly in love' or 'don't give a damn' is incredibly destructive. Emotions are far more nuanced than that."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"That's fair. Worshipping another is bad. Having a disclaimer in place is also not an excuse to screw someone over. I stand by my interpretation, regardless of the intent of the filmmakers. I had a girl from my work who was super in to me, but because of our differences in things like religion and politics I refused to engage with her because regardless of her willingness to be dumped at a later time, and how incredibly hot and willing she was, I just refused to use her for what would have been fun, but was doomed to end in her being hurt. The disclaimer might let some feel absolved of their actions, I hold myself to a higher standard than that."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"I'm mixed on the ""When Harry Met Sally"" honorable mention. Yes I get it, people can start out as platonic friends and have no feelings for one another (like Harry and Sally did), and they can grow over time, but its not impossible for men and women to form strictly platonic friendships.   Not all men and women friends want to get together and have sex with one another."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,You my friend haven't listened to harry enough
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Well at least on the woman’s side. Just sayin.
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"but sometimes they do though, and that's what the movie is about lols"
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"Girl. I'm a bisexual woman, and I definitely had girls and boys as my very close friends even before I started dating. Sure, it's great when you find a partner who's also your good friend, but I think it's just sad that this is still a thing people believe in."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,I didn't expect this one on this list but it makes sense to me that it's on there. This movie reminds me of my current relationship so much.

movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Super right
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Yeah. It is~
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"no that's not realistic. in reality, elio's parents wouldn't be that supportive"
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"I like the movie, but the book is sooooooooooo much better and I would argue even more realistic."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg," @Kurniawan Lee  Amazing movie and realistic movie, too. Of course they would be supportive! All parents, who loves their children, would be supportive of their children, no matter if they are homosexual or not!"
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg," @yuutafan  It's an amazing book as well. It's just the video were talking about movies, so that's why I took the movie."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg," @Yrah S.G.L.H  nooo knowing that they weren't livin' on 21st century yet. In reality they would report oliver to police for sexual assault on minor, then take elio to correctional facility, and after elio ""cured"", they would force  him to married marzia."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Not everybody was homophobic in the 80s. Especially some academic circles (that his parents represented) and underground circles accepted homosexuality. It would have been unrealistic if everybody would have accepted it - but it was just his parents.
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,I thought the film was really boring. Maybe that's just me. It's cool that you guys enjoyed it though.
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Before Sunset is my favorite in the “Before” trilogy. I also really love 500 days of Summer and La La Land but in both cases it kinda breaks my heart that they don’t end up together! I’m a sucker for unrealistic rom coms
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"I think part of the magic of the ""before"" series is that as you mature, the series changes in meaning for you. When I first watched sunrise I was around their age and I was captured by the idealism which was similar to my own.. Now I'm 27 I'm starting to relate to Sunset more."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Daniel L yeah exactly I love how they grow older and more mature in front of us!
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Before Sunset in my opinion was absolutely flawless. Great great dialogue. A thoroughly immersing movie.
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,I'm sucker of same suggest me some
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Carolina Millan duh spoilers 😳
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg," @Carolina Millan  Hello, can we get to know the sweetest girl in the world?"
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Before Sunset is my favourite too in the trilogy.
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Before trilogy is best.But i am hooked up with first part before sunrise .I can't explain in words how much i love that movie..I hate how movie end I wanted them to keep taking and roam around the world...It's sad that the part ended...
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,My best friend’s wedding should have been on the list. In reality someone professing their love for the bride/groom doesn’t stop them from getting married. You are just too late.
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"Yes, omg.  I was SHOCKED when Julia Roberts didn't get her man."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,I had hoped that maid of honor would end the same way.   I thought it was really unrealistic but I loved my best friends wedding.
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"A who,e restaurant does not break out in song."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,I tried watching it again last year but couldn’t finish it because it was so sad that she didn’t get him but it’s one of my favorites because it is so realistic. Just because you love someone doesn’t mean you are gonna get them.
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,cmriley2009 Still pissed about the ending of HIMYM lol
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Crystal and I always will be...himym is the reason I don’t watch cable tv anymore...just watch stuff on Netflix and prime
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"cmriley2009 Totally agree. At least with Netflix and Prime, you can watch all of the episodes of your show faster, instead of being strung along for years to get a BS ending like HIMYM"
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Crystal I know I was so mad and can’t rewatch it it was so important to me but now it just makes me crazy and sad to think about it
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,cmriley2009 Same. So many fans were let down :/
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"Finally, the before trilogy got its recognition. It's the best romance story ever."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,overrated
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg, @Asem Yamak  no it's not if anything it's underrated
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"the ""before"" trilogy is the best acting i've ever seen in my life. so realistic, so pure, nothing seemed forced, stories were incredible."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,One Day is another one of my absolute favorites - with Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturges
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Hylian Cece yes
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"I love that movie, and it doesn't get any more realistic than when she says ""I love you dex, i just don't like you anymore"""
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,The movie doesn’t even touch the sides of the book as well
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Robyn Varley yeaaaaa I read the book too !!
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,So disappointed they didn't add it!!
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Yep
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Yeah! I absolutely love the film. I'm so glad someone spoke about it.
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Princess Usagi that movie FUUUUCKED ME UP
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,That movie is booooring
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,In the end it's kind of depressing
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Blue Valentine is one the best portrayals of love that sparked and lasted for a few “moments”. Sad life.
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Meg Ryan is such an underrated actress. I love how she was able to convey the feelings in the moments she was playing in her face so accurately!
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"those writers and director for 500 days of summer are pure geniuses, plus that expectations vs reality scene was a masterpiece and probably the best scene I seen in a romantic movie."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,10 juno9 the big sick8 la la land7 lost in translation6 like crazy5 eternal sunshine4 blue valentine3 500 days of summer2 amourhonorable mentionsthe break upceleste and jesse foreverwhen harry met sally1 the before trilogy
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,ty
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Woaahhh
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,You just saved me thirteen minutes! Thanks!
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Thank you. Internet requires more heros like you
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,The Before Trilogy is such a masterpiece... each films really shows each  stage of a relationship... the third one being the most difficult to overcome
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"If the Before trilogy wasn't in the first place it would be cheating. I love how Linklater, Delpy and Hawk portray a couple's relationship through many different life stages. Once in an interview someone asked Julie if she would like to play Celine again and she answered it by saying that she would love for them to play those parts until Amour. I really hope we get to see more of Jesse and Celine."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"Her should be on this list. Despite the whole human-A.I. romance, it's still quite realistic in its depiction of romance in general."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"Celeste and Jesse ❤️I felt that's one of the most realistic, heartbreaking and relatable romantic movies out there"
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"The ""Before"" trilogy is amazing! I remember liking the first one more when I was in my early twentys and now close to the thirtys I like the second one so much more, because I relate more with the characters now in that movie, maybe in 10 or 20 years I would put the third one as my favorite."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,The before trilogy is a masterpiece. I watched all three over time  with my love of almost 20 years and it was MAGICAL
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,The before trilogy is a masterpiece
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"The break up hits close to home for me. I had a couple of friends who got divorced. And just like the movie, they ended up dating and marrying carbon copies of their former mates."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"Mike Mill's 2010 movie 'Beginners' was definitely worth considering for the honorable mentions. It is wildly realistic, and mirrors two completely different love stories to a great effect. Definitely worth watching if you liked 'Lost in Translation' or 'Eternal Sunshine...'"
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"I agree with 10 and 9 for sure! (Juno and The Big Sick) I also think Jamie and Landon from a Walk to Remember would be a good one. Yes I know, the cool guy falling for the innocent girl may be a trope but they really were a beautiful couple and the story was wonderful and filled with so many emotions. Also I think Ferris and Sloan could have been an honourable mention from Ferris Buellers day off :)"
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"I watched ""Like Crazy"" while I was in a long distance relationship myself and it was hard. It made question things, fear things, realize things... It was real. And I hated ""Blue Valentine"" because you know, it was Ryan Gosling suffering lol but I do agree with it being on this list."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"I would have included call me by your name since it did not feel like a movie, it felt like watching real life."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,What about Atonement? I feel like the two characters who really loved each other really never got a true chance to be happy. Mostly because of a lie someone told.
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"The main flaw with Blue Valentine is that we see so little of when the couple was actually in love, so we don't get invested in the relationship, and when it breaks apart it seems like another generic divorce movie. Where Eternal Sunshine spends most of the movie developing their relationship, so when the possibility of it being completely erased arrives, we feel a genuine sense of loss of something that was real and meaningful. Blue Valentine had great potential, but this was thrown away because we never saw the build up of how the relationship started and what made it real."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,LOVE LOVE LOVE the before series :) It's so under-appreciated and really needs more fans :) Great movies!!
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,The movie 'once' should've been on this list. It's soooo good!! The songs in it are so great too.
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"I'm a huge fan of well told romances and realistic movies about love and kept going in my head ""don't forget the before-movies, don't forget the before-movies"" till the end. Also Blue Valentine wasn't an obvious choice either but a very good one! Personally, I don't think La La Land is particularly realistic or good for that matter, but besides that a very solid list."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,I've watched almost all movies in this list and that makes me both happy and sad.Happy because they taught me so much about love and showed me the real side of true romance.Sad because they won't blow my mind like they did the first time.😊
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,THE BEFORE TRILOGY IS MY FAVOURITE. THANK YOU FOR NOT ROBBING IT OF THE DESERVING #1 SPOT ❤️
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,"Great picks! Wish ""Love, Rosie"" was on here, even if it was an honorable mention."
movies like lost recommend,wfO_VMhVXGg,Thank you so much for including Amour on this list! That's one heart-wrenching and deeply realistic representation of an older couple's love story. Besides being just an amazing movie with unbelievable acting and directing.

movies before die recommend,_CVV6DOffkU,My all-time favorite movie is: Howl's moving castle!! If you haven't watched it I highly recommend you do!!!!
movies before die recommend,_CVV6DOffkU,"Fun fact: The Shining was one of the very first movies to challenge the theme of American Gothic by setting the movie during daylight the entire time rather than the occasional dark, mysterious , night time setting Gothic genres are known for."
movies before die recommend,_CVV6DOffkU,Another fun fact the little boy didn't know they were shooting a horror movie and it wasn't until he was 16 he found out what all the fuss was about
movies before die recommend,_CVV6DOffkU,"Also my top ten :) 1. The Back To the Future Series ( if I had to pick one, the first)2. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind3.500 Days of Summer4.

Honestly Jen has been such a huge influence in my life for books, movies, music and of course fashion and I just wanna say thanks Jen for putting me onto so many cool and interesting things!!"
movies before die recommend,_CVV6DOffkU,"I always love how your enthuasiasm and passion shines through when you're talking about the movies and books that you've really enjoyed! I'm honestly really guilty of putting movies on me ""to-watch"" list and never quite getting around to them - there's a bit of overlap with that list and yours, but after this video my list has definitely grown too!"
movies before die recommend,_CVV6DOffkU,Hey Jenn!! Love your recommendations. Here are my favs. So difficult to narrow down!1. Star Wars - if I have to pick one Episode III 2. Lord of the Rings - if I have to pick one Return of the King3. Pacific Rim - I think I watched this at least 10 times4. The Grand Budapest Hotel 5. Inception6. Ocean's Trilogy - if I have to pick one Twelve7. 500 Days of Summer 8. Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy - if I have to pick one The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger was so iconic in this.9. La Tortue Rouge - studio gibli + french director = bomb ass film10. Kubo and the Two Srings - extremely underrated
movies before die recommend,_CVV6DOffkU,"I absolutely love this video! There were a few I haven't seen yet, and they are now definitely now on top of my to-watch list. Mine are:• Dead Poets Society• To Kill a Mockingbird• Breakfast at Tiffany's• American Beauty• Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind• Clockwork Orange• Edward Scissorhands"
movies before die recommend,_CVV6DOffkU,I'm completely ENAMORED with eternal sunshine 💛 I've even watched the director and writer's commentary dubbed over it 😹
movies before die recommend,_CVV6DOffkU,"LOVED this video, Jenn!! I always trust your taste so it's safe to say I added a bunch of these onto my to-watch list! My favourite movies include Inception, Black Swan, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, & Her!! :D"
movies before die recommend,_CVV6DOffkU,"I love movie recommendations! My top favorite movies are Stuck in Love (it follows a family of writers who are each navigating their own romantic hurdles) and Treasure Planet which is one of the most underrated Disney movies ever. It’s like a sci-fi, steam punk coming of age story all in one! And the animation and soundtrack are both gorgeous!"
movies before die recommend,_CVV6DOffkU,I love your book and movie recommendations!! You should do a favorite bands/musical artists one next! You're so enjoyable to watch and I love your thoughts on these subjects! :)
movies before die recommend,_CVV6DOffkU,"Jenn You're so well spoken! I love how you explained the films, and now I just want to have a film marathon and watch each film!"

movies before die recommend,_CVV6DOffkU,"Love your selection, we have very similar taste in movies :) if you haven't seen it yet you should really check out ""The Congress"", it fits well into that mind-bending thought provocing sci-fi genre and is partly animated. I hardly ever hear people talk about it but it is a true masterpiece! :) love your videos!"
movies before die recommend,_CVV6DOffkU,"Yes, I LOVE Eternal Sushine of the Spotless Mind! 💛 I watched it as a kid, and it's always stuck with me like bittersweet nostalgia."

It hasn't ended yet, so far it is really good."
movies before die recommend,_CVV6DOffkU,"Based on this list I have a good feeling you would really love films by Wim Wenders. 'Wings of Desire' and 'Paris, Texas' stand out to me, both are very existential. Also Dead Man and anything else by Jim Jarmusch."
movies before die recommend,_CVV6DOffkU,I am so happy Donnie Darko was in here! That was definitely the movie that had me up for nights trying to figure out how everything connected. I love Frank and all of the unique and memorable lines from this film ❤️
movies before die recommend,_CVV6DOffkU,Eternal Sunshine is amazing ! I think you would like The Truman Show which also has Jim Carrey in it !

Movies about great success recommend,N9yEPGypM-I,"Hey D,2 good ones on NFlix I thought you'd dig are Metal Lords and Molly's Game. The former is just a ""feel-good for the odd balls like me"" kinda flick, but the latter is a great story told in a cerebral way that'll you'll enjoy ... I think ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Hope ya dig 'em. I've been diggin' IMBTV for the past couple months, but Paramount might be one for ya to check out too, at least for the free week. Tons of killer stuff, for the kids especially, but a great collection of shows and series too. Might make a good video like this one for your channel. I've been suggesting ya to friends. I also just got the full database of NFlix cat. codes as well if you could use it, I'd be happy to help, just holla ... I dig what ya do. Take it light. Much love!!! ϻя.ƹ"
Movies about great success recommend,N9yEPGypM-I,Always the best .  :) thank you for doing what you do.
Movies about great success recommend,N9yEPGypM-I," @Mr. E  Molly's Game IS very very good, I thought it was a great part of Chastain and Idris Elba as well."
Movies about great success recommend,N9yEPGypM-I,"I've noticed their catalog coming up. I still loathe having to suffer through commercials but since I'm also cheap, well...."
Movies about great success recommend,N9yEPGypM-I,"Fear and Loathing is absolutely meant to be almost an acid trip of a movie. I don't know if read the book, or know that much about Gonzo, but for me the epiphany was when, after the long depraved behaviors and self drug abuse, in a hotel room that's been converted into a Super Fund site, he crawls to his typewriter, and writes something so brilliant, insightful, eloquent... that by itself it would have made his reputation."
Movies about great success recommend,N9yEPGypM-I,"Wow just a awesome list, the only only thing that interest me on IMDBTV is the Boch spinoff in May. Thx again:)"
Movies about great success recommend,N9yEPGypM-I,Just saw Dave made a maze. The set alone is worth watching it.
Movies about great success recommend,N9yEPGypM-I,thx
Movies about great success recommend,N9yEPGypM-I,I liked fighting with my family and a simple favor
Movies about great success recommend,N9yEPGypM-I,"The Endless is amazing and has stuck with me for the 2+ years since I saw it. It incredible what they did with the budget and it may still be my favorite of theirs as well. Lucky Number Slevin is just such a fun movie. great list, some real gems here."
Movies about great success recommend,N9yEPGypM-I,"These are some great recommendations Darren, thanks! I've seen quite a few of them and there are some that have been on my watch list for quite a while. I also like how you always explain exactly what makes each film special and who might not be interested in certain flicks. Redline here I come!"
Movies about great success recommend,N9yEPGypM-I,What a fantastic list. I would argue (IMHO) that Wind River is the top movie. I still to this day think of that film. It was that incredible to me.
Movies about great success recommend,N9yEPGypM-I,"I was shocked at how much i enjoyed this movie; it had pretty much every element that I hate/find boring but I was captivated the entire time. I agree that with you on it possibly being the best film on this list but there are a few I haven’t seen so I can’t say with certainty. But yeah, wow, it was a great movie."
Movies about great success recommend,N9yEPGypM-I,"Added bonus: The Endless is one of my favorite movies ever, and it’s on YouTube for free, in it’s entirety.  Beats having to deal with IMDb’s ads."
Movies about great success recommend,N9yEPGypM-I,"Excellent list, I love so many of these flicks! I've watched Fighting with My Family about 4 times, the tarantula scene in the Sisters Brothers is  And a Simple Favor is too fun and sexy.  Agree with you about Wanted, the action scenes are bad ass ( as is Angelina), but yeah, no need to pay attention to the plot ."
Movies about great success recommend,N9yEPGypM-I,"When I hear the name ""Terry Gilliam"" I AM IN ! My favourite of his is ""The Fisher King"" Flash Mob, a Star on top that falls, mental health with a dash of Arthurian heroics. Brilliant."
Movies about great success recommend,N9yEPGypM-I,"another terrific set of recommendations. Thanks again.Along the lines of your recommendation of 'A League of Their Own' I would point to another girl/sports film, 'Bend it like Beckham'I believe it's currently on HBO streaming serviceExcellent flick. Great direction, great cast, very good acting, some hilarious moments, great soundtrack!I've re-watched it several times and every time I do a just get a big smile on my face"
Movies about great success recommend,N9yEPGypM-I,"This is an amazing list. I have seen most of these and they are top notch movies to watch for free. I've never seen A Simple Favor, so I'll add that to my list and rewatch Wanted, The Endless, & Lucky Number Slevin. Thanks Darren, keep the recommendations coming for free streaming platforms."
Movies about great success recommend,N9yEPGypM-I,"Great list as always. My ordering of these would be different. I've seen them all but ""A Simple Favor"", ""Dave made a Maze"", and ""The Book of Life"". I'll have to check them out."
Movies about great success recommend,N9yEPGypM-I,"Theres some great movies here!! I loved the Crazies remake, Lucky Number Slevin, Wanted, The Place Beyond the Pines, Wind River, Fury, A League of Their Own, Sicario and most of all your #1 Tombstone.  Awesome List."
Movies about great success recommend,N9yEPGypM-I,The place beyond the pines... Man.. I love that film.. The background score.. The generational theme.. That was really a great filmm
Movies about great success recommend,N9yEPGypM-I,For those who don't know I IMDb TV is officially being renamed to Freevee soon. Apparently April 27th the application's name will change to Freevee.Personally I still think their best name for this app was the original freedive name before they changed it to IMDb TV. However that name is going bye-bye and it will soon be known as Freevee in a couple of weeks.Not sure if Darren pointed this out in the video or not but it would be something worth letting viewers know about.
Movies about great success recommend,N9yEPGypM-I,The Endless is incredible. Watched based on Darren's recommendation.

movie to watch in English class recommend,4uerFSSBhko,"I could say that I’m really into romantic films, and I have my favorite one, in the title “Cinderella” I could say that, this movie is kinda musical too, cause I could find a lot of parts where they are singing and it was amazing. So this movie was released on 11 March 2015, it’s a Kenneth Branagh film. Lily James and Richard Madden are in it. It’s set in the 1870-the 1880s somewhere in rural France. It’s based on a book by Masaru Mizutani, who is from Japan. The reason why I’m really into this movie is that I thought it was touching, where cinderella should survive from her devil’s stepmother and finally could found her soulmate. All of the character or artist that are in it is believable, their acting was so excellent and I am still amazed by a lot of special effects that are given in this film, it looks like they working hard on it."
movie to watch in English class recommend,4uerFSSBhko,"I enjoy watching movies, like romcom, thriller, sci-fi, or fantasy. One of my favorite movies is Twilight. It’s a romantic and fantasy movie. It stars Kristen Stewart who was Bella, a female lead character and Robert Pattinson who was Edward, a male lead character. The movie was released in 2008. The movie combined romantic love with Vampire and human beings, which is set in a small town in the US, and the plot was really attractive. I was touched by Bella sincerely and deeply loved Edward, she preferred to become a vampire for staying with Edward forever. On the contrary, Edward constantly tried to prevent her from being a vampire and protected her all the time. they got lots of difficulties but she eventually became a vampire and his wife. It was so sweet and lovely. The movie was based on a series of the same name book written by Stephenie Meyer. There were three sequels after the first movie. I like the first one and the second one most."

Director Mr.Rajamouli took almost 5 years to complete this movie and both the lead actors were quite incredible. Their acting skills in this movie were outstanding. I watched a plethora of movies but it is the best one. It's a historical movie but it is having all emotions like love, happiness, sadness, helping nature and so on."

It was directed by Matt Brown and it stars Devel Patel and Jeremy Irons. The history was really  touching because I think that is a movie that help to make  awareness of various problems in society, as the people can not access o the education and as the dreams can be fulfilled for the love of vocations.The story is of Ramanujan of young Indian that was love the numbers and He wanted that the world know his mathematical formulas. He lifed in a situation of poverty, He worked in a company as accounting assistant and his boss helped him for that Ramanujan can go to Cambridge.In Cambridge He  make a change in the mathematics and He could show his love for the numbers, He was member of the university and He died young but He did history.

movie to watch in English class recommend,4uerFSSBhko,"I want to talk about the movie ""The Medium"", which is one of my favorite movies. The director of the film is Banjong Pisanthanakun. It is a Horror or Supernatural film and is based on the true story of a shaman from Northern Thailand in the Isan area. Shot in footage or pseudo-documentary style resembling Paranormal Activity and The Blair Witch Project, the film begins with a documentary team investigating and surveying the shamanic practices of the Isan people in northeastern Thailand. The film tells the story of the shaman's nephew who is possessed by many evil spirits that he eventually makes everyone possessed and die. I enjoyed the film because the acting cast is very believable, and the screenplay is quite good with the nuances of regional traditions there. This is the best horror documentary I've ever seen."

All of the actors in this movie have really gotten into their own character so they act really well. It is Musical, Romance, and Drama, actually I have never seen a movies based on a musical before, because I used to think that a musical movies is less challenging and boring, but after watching this movies I realized that not all movies have to be and action, but it can be enjoyed by seeing the good storyline. Also The Greatest Showman win the Best Original Song by Motion Picture award on 2018 Golden Globes."

postmodernism movies recommend,qebm_7gGSKw,"Great job ! Thank you ! My English is not that good, so it was a little bit hard for me to follow but it's excellent. Could you maybe write the essential ideas of the video, I mean the caracteristics of postmodernism in film. So for exemple: Parody, intertextuality, referenciality, questionning the ""grands récits"" (Lyotard)...what else ?"
postmodernism movies recommend,qebm_7gGSKw,"Saidi Lydia Thankyou for the comment! Yes, briefly the video says that postmodernist film challenges the mainstream conventions of narrative structure and characterisation. These films challenge the audience's suspension of disbelief through the use of self referentiality, intersexuality and parody. The idea behind postmodernism is to contradict and contest the meta narratives which create, what we see as, 'normality' in the form of society's set of 'collective ideals'. The aim of this theory is to show that these ideals and beliefs are simply social constructions and should not dictate human lives, or in film's case, story narratives.Thanks for watching, I hope you found my explanation useful!"

postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"Development  of the 1960's culture  wasn't  a product of postmodernism ,  it was the cause of it, (postmodern)"
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"This how a physicist gave postmodernism a hilarious black eye and live to tell about .For anyone who pays attention to popular accounts of physics and cosmology, quantum gravity is a thing. How could it not be? Quantum gravity is the place where the two pillars of modern physics—quantum mechanics and relativity—collide head-on at the very instant of the Big Bang. The two theories, each triumphant in its own realm, just don’t play well together. If you are looking for fundamental challenges to our ideas about the universe, quantum gravity isn’t a bad place to start.A bit over two decades ago, quantum gravity also proved to be the perfect honey trap for a bunch of academics with a taste for nonsense and an envious bone to pick with science.In 1994, NYU physicist Alan Sokal ran across a book by biologist Paul Gross and mathematician Norman Levitt. In Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels with Science[3], Gross and Levitt raised an alarm about those in the new field of “cultural studies” who were declaring that scientific knowledge, and at some level reality itself, is nothing but a social construct. Unsure whether he should take Gross and Levitt at face value, Sokal went to the library and dove into the literature that they were criticizing. When he came up for air, he was much more familiar with the postmodernist critique of science. He was also appalled at the depth of its ignorance about the subject.Most scientists respond to such nonsense with a muttered, “good grief,” but Sokal felt compelled to do more. He decided to give postmodernists a first-hand demonstration of the destructive testing of ideas that tie science to a reality that cuts across all cultural divides.Sokal had a hypothesis: Those applying postmodernism to science couldn’t tell the difference between sense and nonsense if you rubbed their noses in it. He predicted that the cultural science studies crowd would publish just about anything, so long as it sounded good and supported their ideological agenda. To test that prediction, Sokal wrote a heavily footnoted and deliciously absurd 39-page parody entitled, “Transgressing The Boundaries. Toward A Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity.”[The paper is worth reading just for a belly laugh. It promises “emancipatory mathematics” at the foundation of “a future post-modern and liberatory science.” “Physical ‘reality’,” it declares, “is at bottom a social and linguistic concept.” He embraces the notion, seriously proposed by some, that logic itself is invalidated by “contamination of the social” When he showed it to friends, Sokal says, “the scientists would figure out quickly that either it was a parody or I had gone off my rocker.”Sokal submitted his paper to a trendy journal called Social Text. Understanding the importance of ego, he freely and glowingly cited work by several of the journal’s editors. For their part, the folks at Social Text were thrilled to receive Sokal’s manuscript. Here at last was a physicist who was “on their side!” After minor revisions, the paper was accepted and scheduled to appear in an upcoming special “Science Wars” edition.The bait had been taken, but the trap had yet to be sprung. That came with a piece by Sokal in Lingua Franca that appeared just after Social Text hit the stands, exposing “Transgressing the Boundaries” as the hoax it was.Parody sometimes succeeds where reasoned discourse fails. Sokal’s little joke burst free of the ivory tower on May 18, 1996, when The New York Times ran a front-page article entitled, “Postmodern Gravity Deconstructed, Slyly.”The Sokal Hoax became a hot topic of conversation around the world!Reactions to Sokal’s article were, shall we say, mixed. The editors of Social Text were not amused, to put it mildly, and they decried Sokal’s unethical behavior. One insisted that the original paper was not a hoax at all, but that fearing reprisal from the scientific hegemony, Sokal had “folded his intellectual resolve.” It was lost on them that had they showed the paper to anyone who knew anything about science or mathematics, the hoax would have been spotted instantly.As most scientists did: When I heard about it, I busted a gut!I still laugh, but the Sakai Hoax carries a serious message. In addition to diluting intellectual rigor, the postmodern assault on science undermines the very notion of truth and robs scientists and scholars of their ability to speak truth to power. As conservative columnist George Will correctly observed, “the epistemology that Sokal attacked precludes serious discussion of knowable realities.” Today, from climate change denial, to the anti-vaccine movement, to the nonsensical notion of “alternative facts,” that blade is wielded on both sides of the political aisle.Sokal gets the last word. Quoting from his 1996 Lingua Franca article, “Anyone who believes that the laws of physics are mere social conventions is invited to try transgressing those conventions from the windows of my apartment. (I live on the 21st floor.)”"

postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,This is the most concise discussion of this topic that I have yet come across.  Great job!!
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"thanks so much for all your efforts. the videos aren't long, but are thorough and clear and provide great examples to help students of every level understand and review concepts the knowledge of and familiarity with which is often assumed."
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"Thanks this has joined up some of the dots! I hadn't fully appreciated liberalism's development from the enlightenment, and haven't realised it can be thought of as a modernist ideology, which it is so clear to me now that is it.I think both modernism and postmodernism have some truth to them. I agree that people are too diverse and prone to tragedy to reach a perfect state of harmony. I also believe the best way we can get as close to peace and prosperity as possible is to push on with the fundamental tenets of modernism and imo liberalism."
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,Thank you so much for this video. Concise and to the point. Just enough information for me to begin to grasp this concept without overwhelming me.

postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,Watched a couple of videos of this topic and this was very clear and easy to understand!
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"I feel like the presentation of information was messy and confusing. There was the initial presentation of modernism which then jumped into postmodernism, back into modernism and then presented the section on postmodernism. I also think that the visuals provided disappeared too quickly, resembling a random flash rather than a supporting image to be looked at and understood. I think it would have been better to present the info first as modernism, post modernism, compare and contrast, and then conclusion."
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,Found the postmodernist in the thread! ^^^
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"Yes, interesting information but poorly organized."
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"Have a presentation about modernity and postmodernity in about 5 minutes, and god knows I am stressed, but this has helped me so much with building up my presentation. So honestly, thank you. This whole thing is great."
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,This was great. I agree whole heartedly with post modernity in it tells us that there is no objective truth. Or the objective truths that are cannot be correct because they aren’t. Post modernity argues for truths to only be discoverable once we go past the age of reason and into an age of enhanced spirituality
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"Thank you for the upload, I quite enjoy learning about these 'ism's' as I fancy myself as something of a thinker and really get annoyed when some punk ask's a great question with a term I have never heard before, and most of the time it ends in ism. Maybe you could point me in the direction of your favourite summary on neo-classicialism?"
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"you did an amazing job! great video, way to cover costs of history in 9min!"
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,I think this is the only video I've seen that actually manages to explain these two in a way that's understandable.
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"This was pretty fair.  Reminiscent of what we were taught in college where the emphasis was on the art and literature, not the deeply destructive subjectivism, relativism and nihilism that's led to identity politics, distortion and rejection of science, the paradoxical positions of leftists, and the legal bonanza wrapped in ""social justice""."
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"Not gonna lie, I totally get what the postmodernists are getting at, it’s like you study human nature in and out and it’s like this gigantic “WTF! Why didn’t anyone explain the game to me earlier”  And that happens in soo many places. Not that it can’t have it’s good sides too, just that we really have to find our own meaning in it and figure it out."
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,Great course really helps get an overview!!
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"Very understable. Thank you. I don't think quantum mechanics was initially the reason why postmodernists critiqued modernist and enlightenment grand narratives. Lyotard did this but also later expressed he did not understand the hard sciences well enough. Quantum Mechanics does not undermine reason and logic at all and those who think it does are usually not physicist. It does not undermine the possibility of a deterministic world either because the probabilistic nature can be easily summarized in simple and elegant statistics that actually predicts a ""very"" deterministic macro world. Otherwise something like a computer would not work."
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"It's not that quantum mechanics negates determinism, but moreso that the concepts of mutually assured destruction, the heat death of the universe, and the concepts of black holes  make the foundation of science more exposed to critique than it had been in decades. Instead of asking ""what can we learn from science"" we ask ""how did we shape science to ask questions we wanted the answers to?""Of course I'm using postmodern in a cultural sense than a philosophical sense here."
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"...or a car, planet, human-being or universe. Quantum Mechanics was discovered due to the Scientific Enquiry  and subsequent Method developed from Modernism. As R states, if you put in the effort to gain a fuller understanding of it, it reinforces the Modernism ideals at a macro level. If you look at it with a nihilistic approach (ie, TL;DR) you will end up deducing that it is all too hard, cherry pick the bits that work for whatever argument you can come up with (and too be fair, this is QUANTUM MECHANICS - you can bend this any way you want...) and come up with ANYTHING you want to determine."

postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"Thank you so much, this is an incredible thing you do here."
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"Wow, after searching Wikipedia and other sources, THIS (finally) cleared up this subject/these subjects! Here is my take on pretty much the whole kit and caboodle:  I feel that there are valid points to all of the above; the trick would be to incorporate the best of the best of EACH philosophy. I probably won't be able to fit all of my thoughts on this subject in this comment, but I'll give you a few salient points/conclusions I came to after watching this video:  Now, to my understanding: The Enlightenment came in response to new understanding of the physical universe and ways to improve the human condition using science, technology etc. as opposed to SOLELY putting it in ""God's hands"" etc. If one were religious but ALSO a proponent of The Enlightenment, it might be a matter of a ""God helps those who help themselves"" type thing: with new understanding of technology and science, one could indeed potentially improve the lot of man, etc. (yet still holding one’s religious beliefs at the same time).  So, we have technology and science moving ahead at a pretty quick clip…  Now, the error comes in (indeed, why I think certain men and women created the ideals/ideas of POSTmodernism) where science and technology, etc. is utilized to do greater harm than good (i.e., technology utilized for wars, etc.). I suppose that could extend to the invention of firearms (which in and of itself might be fine, but the MISUSE (the keyword here!) of which causes issues.  In a nutshell, “Using technology for evil.” So, what I've gathered here is that postmodernism is not an answer or ""counter"" to the modern era/The Enlightenment etc. but a response to the MISUSE of said technology, philosophy, etc!  Now, those who have used Modernism to dictate the lives of other men (in a robotic fashion) – to try to ""unify"" everyone (I feel) erred.  ALONG WITH science and technology, etc. they tried to create a situation where there is a ""cookie-cutter"" treatment of men and women (to try to make everyone EQUAL for what they FEEL is/was the greater good).  This, unfortunately, reduces one's individuality and free-thinking.  Along with wars, etc., I think this objection to individualism helped create POSTMODERNISM.  Now, personally, I like a portion of a COUPLE of the ideas of postmodernism and think they have validity, such as how I feel art should be something allowed to be expressed organically and in an individualistic manner (not to ""conform"" to some narrative).  I also believe that people should have the right to have their own viewpoint (even if it counters a scientific reality) as long as it's not used to harm others. If one sees an elephant and chooses to call it a dog, that's fine. But if that elephant, being treated like a dog suffers or certainly if others suffer, then there is an issue, LOL! (well, sort of LOL).  To wrap up this very short comment (not!) all the above came pouring out just after watching this video (again, thank you for an amazing explanation that no other source to date has been able to accomplish as well).  My nutshell take is that the original ideas & ideals of religious philosophy has its place.  It's been proven that individuals without a lasting faith of some sort (in a higher power, spirituality, etc.) tend not to do as well. There, indeed for some, may be a place for prayer. There's a place for religion (as long as it doesn’t lean toward creating counter-productive situations, etc.).  I also believe there is definitely a place for science and technology and some of the ideas of the modern era/The Enlightenment, etc.  Lastly, I certainly also believe that a FEW of the points of Postmodernism have a validity: each individual should be allowed to have their own viewpoints (no matter how much they may counter the scientific narrative, evidence, etc.) as well as how one should be free to create art of ANY kind, as long as it doesn't overtly harm others, which comes from the individual and not forced from a cookie-cutter narrative, etc.  Lastly, from my observation, one should use science, technology etc. sanely and for the greater good.  I’m sure there are some that won’t agree with everything, above.  And that’s cool :-)"
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,Excellent. A very well done summary with practical explanations and examples. Unlike other readings on this subject.
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,I have to present a seminar on this topic tomorrow! Thanks for helping with such a wonderful video.
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"Théodore van Gogh? He painted a little I believe, but it was his brother Vincent who was the famous one, right? Oh well."
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"Thanks, Vincent.  Appreciate the correction.  Yes, I meant Vincent"
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"You're welcome, glad you didn't mind my comment!"
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,is that a fedora i see m’fellow friend
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I," @Coşku  Yes indeed! It's my dad's, but I think it suits me all the same."
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,Ah ! post structuralism at play here which is central to the development of post modernism. Vincent here is a signifies the great painter who shot himself to death but it also is signifying some dude who wants to keep his memory alive by correcting a mistake which is indeed a signfier to vincent as he mistakenly shot his ear instead of head
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,Must have been his white supremacy
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"It’s all relative, or not"
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,😅
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,I thought it was Go not Gof myself.
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"I had no idea about these topics, but this video cleared all my doubts"
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"Modernism: we reject traditional grand narratives. Postmodernism: we reject traditional grand narratives, and we mean it this time. 😁"
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"very good content, but the video editing could have some improvements, everything fades to black too soon and stays in the black too long, this is disorienting when the narration is on the subject but the screen is black."
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,So where do we stand now? Are we still in the midst of postmodernism or has it run its natural course? If so what kind of future are we moving towards? What are its guiding principles? Or is that up to us to decide?
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"We are now in age of post-truth. It is beyond postmodernism, a subsect of post-postmodernism"
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"thank you for the video, short n sweet video with the simplest way of explanation."
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"In this video we regularly see quotes claiming what postmodernism means or what it is. But if you are going to put a quotation as if to suggest a  precise definition, how can you not indicate who actual said it? According to whom are those definitions accurate?"
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"Post Modernism begun with the bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. At this point all certainties and universal ideologies became meaningless in the presence of total annihilation. Truth became relative and reality, as a Modern concept, became ambiguous and transitory. There was no end point, everything was in flux - until the ‘end of History’ was erroneously declared at the end of the 20 Century. Post Modernism can be best described as ‘what’s the point?’. That’s not a nihilistic summary but a positive one - is everything valid? Unfortunately in some Western countries, Post Modernism has been superseded by solipsism, nostalgia and deceitful reactionary forces. Which is also what happened to Modernism."
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,I hope this channel prospers.
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"Thanks, this is amazing!"
postmodernism movies recommend,f8EfyhIv72I,"Thanks alot, very useful :)"

movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,The secret is that the moustache is the most accurate part. 
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Hes such a good performer

movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,I read this as he said it
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,I got you guys2:30
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,The breaking of character is amazing
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,That was hilarious also when he said your an angry gay
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,They break character in this video?!? :Oshocked pikachu face
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,The breaking of character really is comedic timing. Its so hard to not laugh with em.
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Ikr
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,1:46 the other guy literally broke character just to laugh when the mom said “you’re an angry gay”
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc, @Axolotl  oml same
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,And when he said @yourr an angry gay”
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"you forgot the part where she answers a phone call for ""just a minute"" in the middle of the movie and you're not allowed to leave or do anything until she gets off the phone 2 hours later"
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,And the movie is paused the entire time
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Yep
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Yessssssss
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,To real
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,HEYYYYYYY GIRLLLLLLLL
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,“Ok I’m back”“Oh I already finished the series a few weeks ago”
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"""who is he?""""i don't know, the movie just started"" ""im looking it up""the most accurate thing EVER"
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,pacing? what's that?
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,It's not my mom who does that but my little sister
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"me every time I watch a movie, I'm on IMBD the entire time!"
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,So freaking true
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,this reminds me of my mum too much
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,And then finds out he’s dead before the first words
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,i hate how people do that..why do you want to know everything before the first 5 minutes are up?..just watch the movie show whatever...
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc, @Totally the real Seokjin  ahahah yes
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,My mom does that all the time lol
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc, @aiden  thats not what pacing is
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"Half of me wants to send this to my mom, the other half want’s to live"
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc, @DarklordKermit77  no u
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"Yeh man, I really wanna send this.. but I’m scared she won’t find it funny.. I guess that’s what you guys are worried about too lol"
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc, @aaaz1954  yeah
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,dew it
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Want's
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,i agree
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Move out first then send it to her that way she doesn't have power over you
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc," @bingus!!!!  Actually, you're wrong. Want's would not be used in this sentence, Wants is the correct punctuation in the context he is talking in."
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,The part where the mom just suddenly starts doing housechores in the middle of the movie is the most accurate and annoying thing lol
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Totally :D
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Turns on vacuum cleaner dishwasher washing machine and dryer
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Not for me she just puts on a movie and goes on her phone then she goes too her room and says this is boring even tho it was HER IDEA AND HER CHOICE OF MOVIE
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc, @Roaring Hippo  oof
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Finally I dont feel insane anymore
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Oh phew my moms not the only one.
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Whenever I watch a movie with my grandma she starts doing house chores. My mom goes on her phone. It's fun
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Then gets mad u watched without her.
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,My mom doesn’t do that. But still I can see how all you feel
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,DAD??????
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,I love how Sven immediately breaks character whenever the word 'gay' is mentioned
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,@Gay Furry UwU lol I wish. This is just wishful thinking man. He's obviously straight.
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc, @Fucking grass  Lmao that's a good way of putting it.
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc, @Ihsahn Åkerfeldt  I don’t know I think it’s a “gay” way to put it
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"I feel like their parents always ask sven if he's gay, so it's kinda like an inside joke"
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc," @Ihsahn Åkerfeldt  Ayy, lol."
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,too real for him
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc, @thevideocloset  you should check his channel. He does a lot of videos with his girlfriend
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Gus's acting is so good I almost forgot that the mom was Gus
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Same
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Same
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Oh shit you’re right
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Same actually
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Meanwhile Sven is losing his shit
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,same
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,honestly me too
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Gus's acting is so good that his personality was all a front too
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,“you’re an angry gay.”COMPLETELY LOSES IT
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Gus's face tho
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Angy gay enters the building
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Shoutout to my fellow angry gays
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"""well if your so obsessed with your gay boy"""
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc, @Yeni Trismayanti  ... yeah? it is. spitting facts.
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,You are too
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Hell yea im an angry gay ️‍
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,I read this comment while it played during the video perfectly 
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"This person ""HAHAHAHA SEE! HE SAID ""ANGRY GAY"" AND IM GAY!!! ISNT THAT CRAZY HAHAHAHA"" fly away in 60% of child sexual abuse despite being roughly 1,2% of the population"
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,“you’re an angry gay”love how they broke character during that
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,1:48Gus' face makes it better
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,I may be be gay but I am not offended
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,They broke character a lot in this if you watch closely which is hilarious
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc, @Gay Furry UwU  why should you?
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc, @Gay Furry UwU  I can see you're gay from the namelove the name btw lol
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,I love how she thinks it's like being drunk
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,The most accurate thing is when she falls asleep and says she's just closing her eyes or resting 
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,My mom did that a lot too. Always drove me crazy
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,for me that's my dad
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,My mom fell asleep in a movie theater once
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,I do this all the time!
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc, @K M Weekes  have some respect
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"I would send this to my mom, but I like living too much."
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,I would like the comment but its at 69 likes :(
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,69 nice
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,lol same
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,I sent it to my mom & she was laughing so hard lol
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"I'm 54 yr old mom, just sent it to my 27 yr old daughter. So funny and accurate. Especially during her college years."
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"Dan g, me too"
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Good work copy and pasting this comment
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc, @WalkInToBrickWalls ForDays  I didn’t
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"The one where she asks, ""Who's he???"" in the first minute of the movie is the most accurate representation of my mom watching a movie on the internet."
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"I love how they just cannot stop laughing at their own jokes, especially Sven, it makes me so happy that they can enjoy their own humor. "
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Gus plays the mom perfectly but Sven played us perfectly too so I'll give credit to both of them.
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"The part where the mom asks if he was gay is just hilarious and too relatable. I'm not gay but my mom is convinced I am. She even said the excact words he said in the vid ""Are you gay? You know we'd love and accept you."""
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Get a gf. That might work.
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc, @willow  easier said than done sadly
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc," @willow  The problem is that the lack of a GF is likely the inciting incident for the question.You don't ""just"" get a girlfriend, I'm afraid."
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc," @Red Floyd  easy, you roll dice on deep web mystery boxes"
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"Hey man, feel fortunate to have such a loving mom that she's concocted a preemptive ""We love and accept you"" speech and might be a bit too eager to debut it  Would kill for accepting parents like that"
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc," @Red Floyd  You are right on the money good sir (or sirette, no sexism here)"
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc," @Mollusck Scramp  You know this might sound a bit corny, but the only person that needs to accept you is you. Support is great but not everything."
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc, @willow  Gf's are humans not pets or objects lol.
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Just the way they break character to laugh is the purest shit ever XD
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,It's a testament to your acting skills that despite you having a mustache I legit thought of you as a mother for most of this video.
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,The energy is so raw it feels like this is a real person and not Gus in a wig
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,The whole “I’m not gay though” part was literally the most personal and relatable thing to me EVER
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,I feel like this isn’t scripted and this is just a freestyle of these two characters lmao 
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"I love how moms make everything the kids fault. my mom got food poisoning at subway and made it seem like it was my fault- i just wanted subway, she didnt even have to get anything there."
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"This isn't realistic, a mom like this would have DEFINITELY seen legally blonde"
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"Gus: ""You're so obsessed with your GAYboy.""Me: Dies of laughter"
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"""I'm sorry I just wanted to spend some quality time with my son"" after being a complete nuisance the whole time is so damn accurate."
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,“I- feel attacked-!” Is the most realistic thing I’ve heard
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,You can tell he’s just trying to make his brother laugh the whole time and that’s honestly the most relatable part of these skits.
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,Why is no one talking about that perfect throw that Gus made with the can that bounced right off of Sven's head?
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"this is the most accurate thing I’ve seen in my life. My mom begs me to watch a movie, pesters me about being gay, does house stuff in the middle of it, falls asleep halfway through, and sits in her phone the entire tiem"
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,I love that they just kept breaking character more and more as the video went on
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"The guilt trip that moms do with the whole “Well, ok i just thought i could spend some time with you but that’s clearly too much to ask.” Was scary accurate."
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"""want some popcorn? I'll get you some popcorn. Do you want something to drink?!? You didn't finish this one, I can't keep cleaning up after you!"" and mom falling asleep are the most accurate parts for me "
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"Anytime my mom isn't sleeping, she'll pause the movie and start explaining something from before the 2000's in the movie that I 'don't understand'. Like the other day she paused it for 10 minutes to talk about a retro tv, and how you used the dial to change the channel and volume. And she wonders why I don't want to watch a movie with her"
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"My mom’s a doctor, and besides her usual critiquing of movies that she calls out during the movie and when we pause it, every time there’s a medical scene she also feels the need to point out everything that’s wrong with it and why that is."
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"The hands, it's the hands that makes me forget Gus isn't a mother. He has nailed the art of ""Mom hands"". They just keep their hands open in the air, it's like they speak with their hands."
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"Turns on movie: ""Who's this guy?"" is so accurate lmao"
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,"Did you notice? In a couple ""mom"" sketches Gus' character says ""what am I looking at?"" and both him and Sven laugh. I think their mom may use that phrase a lot."
movies for watching with mom recommend,buKpcZOYuJc,My son made me watch this with him. He laughed and pointed at me the entire video ️hilarious

hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,It should be a federal crime to spoil Psycho’s ending.
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"I agree with you. when ever I recommend it to my friends, I always tell them that it's about a woman who steals some money and runs from the police."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,meh... overrated by this presentation... I would have ranked it #12
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,I want to watch the film but I know that is I watch it I will not sleep for 10 days. 🥺
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"Exactly. This video gave too much information in Vertigo, also."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"Yes! This video gave away some other movie spoilers. I haven't seen ""Strangers on a Train"" yet, but, I feel like ""The Man Who Knew to Much"" now."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04, @TROLL KING  cram it
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,I love how he made murder mysteries both howcatchems and whodunnits
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04, @Great Indian Builder  it's not scary at all unless you aren't a horror fan and can't handle those type of movies.
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"I think Vertigo deserved number 1, an absolute masterpiece!!"
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"""VERTIGO"" is an incomparable masterpiece in every respect!!!"
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,My three favorites are 1) Notorious 2) Vertigo 3) Rear Window. Notorious is the greatest Hitchcock film ever. A Masterpiece and one of my all-time favorites. Ingrid Bergman performs a phenomenal portrayal of a vulnerable character. Notorious also contains one of the most iconic and longest kiss in cinema history. Hitchcock uses his complete mastery of the camera to get away with the 3-second kiss rule and his shots with the keys are perfectly shown to the audience.
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"Psycho is his most well-known, but Rear Window is by far his best movie"
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"i love them both for very different reasons. Rear Window is so well crafted and visually stunning, while Psycho, also well crafted, is almost suffocating with it's dark character studies."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Jack Corcoran I had to watch Rear Window for my history course and it definitely got my attention.
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,I love both of these movies yet I think the movie i confess with Montgomery clift is an incredible movie too
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"North By Northwest --all day, every day.  It encapsulates all of Hitchcock'smost famous devices.  Funny, highly romantic and, of course, suspensful.  Cary Grant was never better."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"You should add: “ in my opinion “, although I find Rear Window the most charming if his films. And people underrate Psycho just because it is a horror film, but once you drop the label the work emerges"
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04," @Cassian Richards  ""in my opinion"" is implicit in every comment."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Here you go again speaking for everyone else
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04," @Cassian Richards  you forgot to add ""in my opinion""."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,mazs1123 I did it .. I find ...
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Jack Corcoran I would say Vertigo is his best movie
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,1. Vertigo2. Rear Window 3. Psycho4. North by Northwest5. Notorious6. The Birds7. Spellbound8. Dial M for Murder9. To Catch a Thief10. Shadow of a Doubt
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,To catch a thief 👍🏻
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,I confess is good too
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Marnie is one of my favorites.
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"Vertigo and Rear Window both had the wrong stars together James Stewart should have had female co-stars nearer his own age.  He was nearly 30 years older than Grace Kelly and Kim Novak.   North by Northwest was iffy for the same reason, but Cary Grant could pull it off."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,What about frenzy
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,What about charade?
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Gary McKinley bullshit the female leads were perfectly okay them being 20-30 years younger is okay as long as their both adults
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Gary McKinley no north by northwest wasn’t iffy in the romance department stop complaining there’s nothing wrong with older men dating younger women
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04, @Gary McKinley  you are too young to understand it.
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04, @Gary McKinley  Stewart looked like their father.  Hitch could have found a 45-50 year old female for the lead. Someone like Marlene Dietrich. He did two movies with her as the female lead. She carried one on them;  ' Stage Fright.'
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,I know some of these films are over 50 years old but a spoiler warning would still be appreciated. 
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Jacob Jeffries agreed.. they could talk about the movies without giving away the entire plot.
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"Jacob Jeffries thanks man, I suspected and read your comment at the top. Thank you."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"No Kidding, I was trying to decide which movie to watch and now I'm like, well I guess I'm not watching Dial M for Murder."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,That's exactly what I was thinking. I've only seen one Hitchcock movie so far ( it's Rear Window in case you're wondering ) and I'd like to see the others.
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"That's the first Hitchcock movie I saw too! His movies are truly amazing, I've just watched Psycho today and I'm in so much awe. Try watching Rope or the other Jimmy Stewart/Hitchcock movies. North by Northwest is an awesome and breathtakingly stylish film. Vertigo had one of the best twists ever and some others that don't make the cut like To Catch a Thief and Marnie are still really fun to watch."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Jacob Jeffries ikr
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,that's what spoofs and references are about at times
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,I never seen his movies
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Belated comment -- yes -- I have seen most of these films and spoiler warnings would have been helpful.  Much better (discrete) list is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sxyirGXWSg
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"But his movies are so boring, don’t know why you Would want to watch these!"
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,There is no such thing as a bad Hitchcock movie.
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"Eh, i personally don't like Rebecca"
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,It's interesting considering that's the only Hitchcock film to win Best Picture at the Oscars.
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Marnie.
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04, @Tommy Litz  i loved Marnie
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"I haven't seen all of them, but I've seen many. But I don't like the movie 'the Birds', I just don't like the plot."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Except Family Plot.  🙄
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04," @satori cmaylo  as did I. did not care for Topaz, Family Plot, or Torn Curtain."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Yep
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,I didn’t like Jamaica inn
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,North By Northest is the worst movie from him I've seen so far. Psycho is very overrated either.
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"""Rear window"" is his masterpiece. Gorgeous Grace Kelly"
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Beautiful kelly
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Would watch that movie just for grace Kelly
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04," @Cole Casstevens  she was in dial m for murder in the same year aswell, both movies were great"
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"Phuong Ton Are you saying "" Grace Kelly was a MASTERPIECE """
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Please don't spoil the plot for people who haven't watched these classic beauties. I mean WTF
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"North by Northwest is my favorite, I just love Cary Grant’s performance and charm."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"It's so hard to choose one film, in my view they are all great and timeless. Hitchcock will always be the master."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"Vertigo is my favourite. I disagree with people who say it's overrated. Amazing film, but of course, that's just my opinion."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,It is phenomenal.  With the exception of finding a place for Shadow of a Doubt I think this is an excellent list.  Trouble is you cannot list 10 Great Hitches.  There are so man
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"Totally agree. My top three are Vertigo, North by Northwest and The Man Who Knew Too Much."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Vertigo is my first choice too.
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Loved it own it.
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"I like Rear Window, North by Northwest, Psycho, Vertigo, and especially Strangers on a Train."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,It's a masterpiece! No debate!
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"i LOVE Vertigo too...wasn't really happy rope only got an H.M. tho...but i do think almost EVERYBODY agrees Psycho is #1...not just bcuz it's the best hitchcock movie...but like she said...""it changed the way films were viewed and made""....for 1960, that was a very ""daring"" film...ESPECIALLY with the shots of semi-nudity and violence...no other movie before psycho took those kind of chances..."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,eclipsesonic and a great opinion it is!
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Well if it wasn't for groundbreakers like Hitchock  You'd still be watching Donald duck goes shopping. Just my opinion.
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,eclipsesonic just watched it today and I'm still in shock. It's better than psycho
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"""Notorious"" and ""Shadow of a Doubt"" will always be my favorites. SOAD also has the distinction of being Hitchcock's favorite as well.  😊"
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,IMO it's impossible to pick a best Hitchcock movie.  They all have different things that make them great.
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,David Johnson my favorite is psycho
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Vertigo is easily his best.
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,My all time favourite is 'To Catch a Thief' - a beautiful movie with Grace Kelly and Cary Grant.
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,OMG I didn't even realize they didn't mention that one
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,39 Steps script is WAY ahead of its time and the pace is incredibly fast. Best movie ever.
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Vertigo is hitchcock’s greatest masterpiece
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,There was never a doubt what the #1 was going to be.  I'd put Rear Window at number 1.  One of the great masterpieces in movie history.  For most of the movie the audience shares the perspective of the protagonist looking out at his neighbors.  It's really an amazing film.
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,I have a special place in my heart for REAR WINDOW.
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Randy Bailin I knew it would be PSYCHO since it’s so good
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"The most underrated Hitchcock is definitly ""The Lady Vanishes""."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"Robert Walker was incredible in Strangers on a Train, it was truly a perfect casting choice"
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Family Plot is such an underrated flick. Barbara Harris was a comic gem.
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"I like Rope better than Strangers on a Train as far as Farley Granger films go, and Spellbound better than Notorious as far as Ingrid Bergman films go.My favourites overall are: Vertigo, Rear Window, and Dial M for Murder. Psycho is really great, but overrated relative to Hitchcock's other films; as is the shower scene, the concert hall assassination scene in the remake of The Man Who Knew Too Much BLOWS it away."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"Shadow of a Doubt is Hitchcock's greatest film, and his greatest artistic accomplishment: it possesses a flawless formal perfection that is to be found in very few films in the history of cinema."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"All of his films were great, and could have been listed in any order - depending on one's mood."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"Rebecca should be near the top. It's genius is the the movie's namesake never makes an appearance yet is so central to the story. I favor North By Northwest, Notorious, Rear Window, and The Man Who Knew Too Much."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,North by Northwest is my favorite although I admit I haven't watched them all.
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Who already knew Phsyco was number one before clicking on this video?
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Vertigo is becoming my favorite. Plus Kim Novak is my favorite actress.
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"All the films earned the top ten status,  but three more of my favorites weren't there although they did get honorable mention.  Rope, Strangers on a Train, and Nortorious.  Torn Curtain was wonderful also."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"Psycho, Rear Window, Vertigo and Dial 'M' for murder are my favourites"
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"Vertigo has been my favorite movie (of ALL movies) since I was 13. I have also a great love for Spellbound. It's a fascinating early feminist story, despite the cheesy psychologizing."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Il a créé tellement de chefs d’œuvres que j'aurais de la peine à n'en retenir que 10.
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"Spellbound, vertigo, real window and stranger on the train! I love these movies!"
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"Missing from your Top 10 list, “Shadow of a Doubt” is my favorite Hitchcock film; and, according to his daughter, it was his favorite, too. (Scripted by Thornton Wilder, author of Our Town.)"
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Psycho: unsurpassed masterpiece!!! 🇧🇷
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"Rope should have been top 10, and To Catch a Thief should have been an honorable mention. Also Vertigo and North by Northwest should have been ahead of rear window."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"Respectable top 10 list but I think ""Shadow of a Doubt"" should be in the top 10. My favorite of Hitch's 1940s films and Joseph Cotten's Uncle Charlie is Hitchcock's best villain IMHO."
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,Vertigo is my favorite movie of all time! A perfect movie!
hitchcock movies recommend,fVoVdKOLP04,"I do agree, because Psycho and Rear Window are my favorites, but I really enjoy Saboteur as well. :)"
hitchcock movies recommend,GiFTREw4dsg,I think Vertigo should've been number one... the greatness of this movie it's unbeatable
hitchcock movies recommend,GiFTREw4dsg,"It is a fantastic movie, was a tough choice between that and our number one pick."
hitchcock movies recommend,GiFTREw4dsg,"I don't think anything can triumph Rear Window! They are all fantastic though. I love Dial M for Murder, North by Northwest, and Rebecca. But the creativity and craftsmanship of Rear Window is sublime to me!"
hitchcock movies recommend,GiFTREw4dsg,"His movies are so good that just about any list is acceptable. For me, of these, North By Northwest is my favorite."
hitchcock movies recommend,GiFTREw4dsg,Same my dad showed me Vertigo and NBNW when I was a kid and they both blew my mind. I think NBNW stuck w me so much bc it’s not as adult as vertigo and I like Cary grant better.
hitchcock movies recommend,GiFTREw4dsg,"I have watched this man's movies so many times and still I go back to them, truly one of the greatest to ever do it. 1. Vertigo 10/102. Psycho 10/103. Rear Window 10/104. Notorious 9/105. Rebecca 9/106. North by Northwest 9/107. Shadow of a Doubt 8/108. The Lady Vanishes 8/109. Dial M for Murder 8/1010. The Birds 8/10"
hitchcock movies recommend,GiFTREw4dsg,"not gonna lie but , i didn't like vertigo that much , the moment the twist is revealed the movie fall apart for me , the last act was a chore to get throw leading to one of the most disappointed and random ending ever , it almost ruin what was mostly an amazing movie"
hitchcock movies recommend,GiFTREw4dsg,"Great list but only North by Northwest is masterpice and one of 4 best movies of Hitchcock for me second best only Vertigo is better, but Vertigo, Psycho, North by Northwest and Rear Window are best Hitchcock movies, but great list"
hitchcock movies recommend,GiFTREw4dsg," @BLUE FIRE  I agree.  I have sympathy for both Vertigo camps: I applaud those who value the psychological themes within it, but it’s too laborious and dull for my taste."
hitchcock movies recommend,GiFTREw4dsg,"I freaking love Rear Window and Psycho, specially the very last scene from Psycho still gives me chills"
hitchcock movies recommend,GiFTREw4dsg,"I have watched Psycho, Vertigo, Rear Window, Dial M For Murder, Strangers On A Train, The Birds, North By Northwest, To Catch A Their and The 39 Steps. The best movie from Alfred Hitchcock, in my opinion, is Psycho."
hitchcock movies recommend,GiFTREw4dsg,"Have to put North by Nortwest first, quite simply because it, IMHO, is the most perfect film I have ever seen. Seen it +50 times and still the best. Plot, cinematography, music acting, actors, drama, suspense, pace, lighting  everything just perfect."
hitchcock movies recommend,GiFTREw4dsg,"For me, Psycho is the best move I’ve ever seen. What a movie."
hitchcock movies recommend,GiFTREw4dsg,I have watched 90% of Hitchcock movies...To me 'The Birds '  is something from alien ❤️ Respect from Bangladesh
hitchcock movies recommend,GiFTREw4dsg,The little girl is in 'Alien'
hitchcock movies recommend,GiFTREw4dsg,"Shadow of Doubt would be in my top 10 and for some reason I don't admire Vertigo as most do. As a kid growing up in the '50s, Dial M For Murder made the biggest impact."
hitchcock movies recommend,GiFTREw4dsg,"1) Psycho2) Rear Window3) Dial M For Murder4) The Birds5) North by NorthwestThat would be my Top 5 right now (it constantly changes).  I can't stand Vertigo; I find it unbelievably dull.  Other phenomenal ones include The 39 Steps, Saboteur, Rope, The Trouble With Harry, Frenzy - there are lots of great ones aren't there? :)Thanks for the great video!"
hitchcock movies recommend,GiFTREw4dsg,"Your taste is similar to mine. I've been putting off watching Vertigo as i've a feeling i won't like it because i don't like Spellbound or Rebecca and find those boring, which are often thought to be great ones, but i think i'll watch it this evening."
hitchcock movies recommend,GiFTREw4dsg," @jon bolton  I could not agree more!  Good luck watching Vertigo.  I found Rebecca overrated too (not nearly as exciting as some of his other films) and though I didn’t hate Spellbound, I’ve not been anxious to return to it."
hitchcock movies recommend,GiFTREw4dsg,"Thanks. I just watched Vertigo and wasn't impressed, i'd rank it below even Rebecca. My favourites are pretty similar to yours, Rear Window, Frenzy, Dial M For Murder, Psycho, North By Northwest and Rope."
hitchcock movies recommend,GiFTREw4dsg,"'It takes', my granny used to say, 'all sorts to make a world.'I'm the other sort: I love Vertigo--- love that claustrophobic atmosphere that it engenders!"

hitchcock movies recommend,GiFTREw4dsg,I feel like To Catch a Thief is criminally underrated by many. Most people won’t even mention it at all when discussing his best works. I adored it and I’m glad to see someone else who was a big fan too!
hitchcock movies recommend,GiFTREw4dsg,Vertigo is his masterpiece
hitchcock movies recommend,GiFTREw4dsg,"Best directors had 4 masterpices, some like Bergman, Fellini, Scorcese and some others but great directors i dont knows why had 4 masterpices just like Hitchcock or Wilder"

hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,James has two groups of fans: gamers and movie lovers. I am both.
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,Vic Jang same here!
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"wow, you are so unique"
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,Err news flash! Most people are
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,Same
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,So there’s three groups of fans?
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,well ain't you special...James is much more into music than games. He's a metalhead and though he doesn't do hardly any music related content anymore he has put out some good stuff in the past like audio slaughter
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"Isn't that three groups? Gamers, Movies lovers and lovers of both?"
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,Same honestly I love them both
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,Same here
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,Same
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg," I like Hitchcock's bomb theory. You can do a bomb scene in two ways. One is you have two men sitting at a table talking about baseball for five minutes when a bomb under the table explodes and the audience has a brief, horrible shock. Or you let the audience know there is a bomb under the table when the scene starts so during the five minutes the audience will be yelling, ""stop talking about baseball you a-holes, there is a bomb under the table!"" That is how you create suspense."
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,It's principaly an inspiration from orson welles methodology
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,Matthew Bissonnette Hitchcock would choose the latter.
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg," @Sammy R. ---  That single-shot opening is one of the most impressively choreographed scenes in motion picture history...and many people don't even notice it. Also the opening shot from, ""The Player"" is something to appreciate as well."
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"its a boy with a bomb on a bus from sabotage and that predates wells, should include the 39 steps ,the lady vanishes, to catch a thief, Rebecca, and the original man who new to much"
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg," @Ark Terror  yes 39 steps and to catch a thief definitely,man who knew too much shouldnt be on the list didnt like leading lady in that"
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg," @Ark Terror  i keep seeing the lady vanishes on this comments board,that 1 i diagree on,thats part of hitchcocks war years syllabus, 1 thing i love about hitch's war years movies he doesnt really make an outright propaganda film except maybe the final speech in lady vanishes,that brings that movie down in my opinion,even lifeboat the german captains a bad guy but no one else on the boat is a saint either,i would replace lady vanishes with Mr. and Mrs. Smith,its hard to believe he made that in 41 and hitchcock was british,i just fall in love with carol lombard when i watch that"
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"Rear Window has to be my favorite. When I first saw, I couldn't even comprehend my emotions: I was in bigger suspense that moment that in most of my life. And for that, Rear Window deserves a place in my heart."
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,The Birds is fascinating becasue it has no music whatsoever. It's good for budding composers as it's basically a clean slate in which to practise.
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"Even without music, Hitchcock finds ways to convey suspense and shock.  And Mrs. Bundy is my favorite minor character ever."
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,Lifeboat does have music but only over the titles and the 'The End' card
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"the birds was 1 of hitchcocks most original movies too,only straight up monster movie he did"
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,I think that 'Rebecca' is a truly under appreciated Hitchcock film. It's one of my favorites.
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,That was his best Movie
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,Absolutely
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"Won the ""Oscar"" for best picture of its year. I was surprised it wasn't on the list. I love all of his movies but I wouldn't have considered ""Rope"" as top-ten material."
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"I think people think of it just as much as a Selznick film as a Hitchcock film, which leads to people underrating Hitch's contribution. Personally, I think the fact that he made the film so much his own even with Selznick constantly interfering shows his genius even more: „In der Beschränkung zeigt sich erst der Meister.“"
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"Christopher : Mine too. Daphné DuMaurier really treated Hitchcock well. I also love Marnie. Call it corny, but I probably liked a woman criminal. I definitely like their relationship. Probably because I am a woman."
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"Christopher : It has the most interesting ‘twist’, revealed in the happiest of ways."
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,Just the best!
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,Rebecca was my favorite. Probably could replace the Birds on this list.
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"Totally agree, in fact, I think Rebecca is Hitchcock’s best movie and one of my all time favourites. I just love how you can relate to the characters and their psychological arcs, brought to life by great acting. It totally deserved the Oscar."
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,I can't believe that it wasn't on the list
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"It's 7 years old but I'll add mine. Notorious is my personal favorite. Vertigo is his best, it's brilliant and artistic. Psycho is a must. The Birds is a must, especially for horror fans. Rope holds a very special place in my heart because I love long takes. North by Northwest is his most entertaining. Strangers on a Train holds up exceptionally well."
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,You posted the comment past the expiration date.
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,The 39 Steps is really underrated. It’s probably one of Hitch’s best British films.
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"According to the British Film Institute, it’s the 4th best British film ever made. I’d hardly call that ‘underrated’ myself."
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"I don't like using the word ""best"" to describe movies. Film is subjective, so there can be no ""best"" or ""worst"" - only ""favourite"". Popularity is not a measure of quality either."
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg, @Syklone  Be sure to check out the play... it's incredible fun!
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,But it has little to do with John Buchan's novel of the same name.
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"BenCol Fair, it’s just that you don’t often hear it in the same breath as “Vertigo” or “Psycho” when folks discuss Hitch’s movies."
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"I love 39 steps, but lady vanishes is my fave from that era."
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,what about the lady vanishes from 1938? (Fun fact: Hammer’s last film of the 20th century was not To The Devil A Daughter from 1976 but was a 1979 remake of The Lady Vanishes. The reason why the people think Hammer’s last film was To The Devil A Daughter is that it was the last film of Hammer Horror.)
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,Definitely in my top ten
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg," @BenCol  perhaps it is among US reviewers. Certainly, it rarely makes YouTube videoers top 10. It makes mine"
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg, @james stubbs  Both make my top 10
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"Nice to see Rope on your list, often overlooked - I think it is a masterpiece."
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"I still have quite a lot of the movies to get through, but here's my list so far-1) The Lady Vanishes2) Notorious 3) Spellbound4) The 39 Steps5) Rope"
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"The Lady Vanishes is indeed superb, with wonderful humor as Hitchcock makes fun of the British."
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"Yes I agree, the lady vanishes is quite a dreamlike gem."
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,I recently watched Rear Window as it's now on Netflix - I was really intrigued by the realistic pacing of conversations between the characters and little things each of them did  that felt so genuine - that part of it really pulled me into the movie. I really enjoyed it!
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,jesslovesrammstein then watch north by northwest it is so thrilling that you dont know where the movie is taking you 100% great.
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"james always has a down to earth way of explaining things, even though i may not agree i certainly respect his well thought out opinions"
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,Took a class on Hitchcock. Watched a bunch of his films. I like this list. Shadow of a Doubt is great. I was lucky to have that class. Hitchcock was way ahead of his time and could still teach the directors now a thing or two
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,Check out the movie Sabotage. YouTube has it in it's entirety but it's a very bad print. It has one of his most disturbing murders in it. You say to yourself he's not going to do that. I know he's not. Then he does it. It's horrible.
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,Everything was better before 1980.  Movies  television  sports  real food.  real people   prices. rents   wages  personal safety  the justice system  the banking system  respectful kids.  vacation costs.  It s only a dream. Just a memory. With nowhere to stay
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg, @Dave Hallett  ok boomer
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"James, you oughta teach film classes in college. You'd be a great professor"
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,I would like to be his student
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,That would be cool and awesome.  He'd be better then my film professor
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"Hi, for me it is impossible to classify Hitchcock's films as the relationship between his films and the viewer is so intimate. The 39 steps, Rebecca, Spellbound and many others are true masterpieces. Thank you very much for this video ! Cyril, Hitch fan from France."
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"Notorious was so good. Kinda shocked you left it out, still a good list though. Its easily in my top ten films of all time which would also inlcude Vertigo and North By Northwest"
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,I see this is old but I’ll comment anyway. It still annoys me that Mission Impossible 2 is a complete ripoff of Notorious and I don’t think I have ever heard a single person talk about that movie and mention Hitchcock. Drives me nuts.
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"North By Northwest will always be my favorite Hitchcock film.  The humor, adventure and cast are phenomenal.  It's one of a handful of movies (like the original Die Hard) where the villain is so charismatic (James Mason) that you can't help but like him.   Glad to see Rope make this list as well.  I always thought it was seriously underrated."
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"I love Hitchcock's movies, especially 'Vertigo' and 'Rear Window'"
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,I just watched Dial M For Murder for the first time. Brilliant film.
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,Yup. It's my favorite Hitchcock film.
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,I saw it when it was little several times as my aunt had to explain it.
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,So underrated
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,After Dial M for Murder I clapped applause. My personal favourite Hitchcock
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,It would have made my list for sure along with frenzy
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,Me too
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,My personal favorites.12. Family Plot11. Spellbound10. The Birds9. Rear Window8. Rope7. Frenzy6. Rebecca5. Psycho4. Notorious3. Strangers on a Train2. Vertigo1. North By Northwest
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,+Advent3546 Great List. Frenzy and Spellbound are criminally underrated
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg, @Tyler Lipman  Thanks but looking back I'd switch Rebecca with Rear Window.
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"Both are Great. I have your same top two. Rear Window is like a perfect film. All shot in one room, not only are you following the killer but you're finding out about his other neighbors and Stewart and Kelly's relationship growing. I don't know how you aren't into Grace Kelly though back then. Damn"
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,I also love Marnie and Torn Curtain
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,Frenzy is awesome
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"Thank you for not including Man Who Knew Too Much, that one is overrated even with Jimmy Stewart."
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"I liked frenzy, would have included in my top 10. I saw all these except rope."
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,I dont understand north by North why yaar
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"This list just proves how underrated Alfred Hitchcock's Lifeboat really is. What a criminally underrated film for anyone to see. It's personally one of my favorites. It's interesting how the movie didn't need much to grab the audiences attention. All it had was a clever script, classic brute acting and the feeling of surreal helplessness. I highly recommend it to anyone that's starting a Hitchcock marathon."
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,My favorite thing about Psycho is that it doesn't have a Hollywood super star playing a character supposed to be 20 years younger than him.
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"For me: 3. Rear Window, 2. Dial M for Murder and 1. Psycho. Easily my favorite Hitchcock film."
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"Frenzy made me laugh the most, even though it's probably one of the most graphic movies with the choking scenes. The part that makes me laugh is the detective and his wife's horrible cooking."
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"James, being so knowledgable on movies you should definitely do more of these...I'd love to see some top 10 Billy Wilder, Fritz Lang or Luis Bunuel films"
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"I've watched Frenzy and I think also this movie is underratted, I love it!"
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"Hard to argue these. My personal favorite is Notorious. Nonstop suspense and a great cast of Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Raines."
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"Hitchcock is my favourite director of all time! I loved watching this video, thank you!"
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,Its great and very relieving to know that there are still young kids growing up and having such an appreciation for great cinema classics. Good for you lad.
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"I strongly agree with your #1. Vertigo is one of the best cinematic experiences I've ever had. It is truly a magical film. James, I agree with you that Hitchcock is one of the best; a true Master and Auteur"
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"I was so happy North by Northwest was placed so highly on this list, because my high school film teacher made us watch it and go over the little things Hitchcock did to make his movie. And my film teacher was really good at making the entire class laugh, so at least we didn't have to suffer the entire school day. "
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"My favorite Hitchcock is 'The Lady Vanishes', from back in his Islington days, with Margaret Lockwood and Michael Redgrave.  The Intrigue is rife in that one."
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,I love vertigo! Kim Novak was so beautiful and with the music it just set things right. You even fall in love with Kim Novak with that music. Ugh it gives me chills!
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,So many great Hitchcock films. Even the later ones like Frenzy are good. Love the humor in Frenzy with the police chief and his wife's cooking.
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"Great top 10! ‘Psycho’ & ‘Rope’ are part of my top 5 especially with their technical prowess, the writing & the acting are just brilliant"
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,"What I love about it is the score by Bernard Hermann (which I think is amazing), the story and its sense of mystery, the direction, atmosphere, visual style and performances make it my favourite Hitchcock film. We all have our different tastes, so there's nothing wrong if you don't like it that much, but that's why I and many others love it."
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,I really enjoyed 'The Wrong Man' lots of nice camera movement in the film!
hitchcock movies recommend,7sxyirGXWSg,He's my personal favorite director.
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"This is why you’re one of my favorite people on this platform, you watched fifteen different movies just to make this video... Keep doing what you do!"
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,Noah Lasher it was a fun month!! Thank you so much Noah! These sorts of comments motivate me to do more :)
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,watching hitchcock movies isnt exactly a penance though
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo," @andrion waser  I think he was more so saying taking the time to watch them, not how hard it is to watch them"
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,Here are my personal 5 favorite Hitchcock films5. North by Northwest4. Pyscho3. Vertigo2. Notorious1. Rear Window
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,Paul Lee GREAT list!!
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"It is great seeing someone being so passionate about 'The Master of Suspense'.Your video inspired me to do a Hitchcock ranking myself (just for the record, more than half of them I haven't watched since the age of 10):33. Topaz (bad and boring)32. Family Plot (unworthy end of a fantastic career)31. Pleasure Garden (can't remember much)30. The Ring (not so interesting)29. Number Seventeen (mostly dece with a nice ending)28. The Wrong Man (haven't seen since childhood; can't remember much)27. The 39 Steps (basis for many later Hitchcocks such as 'North by Northwest' and 'Saboteur')26. Stage Fright (plot meh, characters very good)25. Torn Curtain (has a few good scenes)24. Notorious (highly overrated imo)23. I Confess (interesting plot)22. Marnie (same plot as 'Spellbound' but not as good and with horrible matte painting)21. The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934) (great acting, great finale)20. Secret Agent (very suspenseful for a 1930s flick)19. Shadow of a Doubt (a bit overrated, yet a great film)18. Rebecca (first half is okay, second half is perfect)17. Saboteur (very relatable protagonist and iconic ending)16. Suspicion (great story with lousy ending due to censorship)15. The Lady Vanishes (really like the setting and the humour)14. The Man Who Knew Too much (1956) (gorgeous soundtrack with fantastic actors, yet an anticlimatic ending)13. Spellbound (did you know that the dream sequence was designed by Salvador Dalí?)12. Sabotage (that bomb scene “blew me away“ as a kid)11. North by Northwest (Bernard Herrmann at his best)10. Lifeboat (great dialogue and very suspenseful)9. The Trouble with Harry (one of the best comedy films I've ever seen)8. Dial 'M' for Murder (very unpredictable plot with a nice Agatha Christie touch to it)7. Frenzy (his last masterpiece)6. Rope (fantastic atmosphere with great dialogue and actors)5. Psycho (there is a reason this is one of the ultimate film classics)4. Strangers on a Train (features one of the best antagonists in film history)3. The Birds (first half has a superb 'calm before the storm' atmosphere and the second half is full of classic moments)2. Vertigo (scared the hell out of me as a kid, especially the dream sequence)1. Rear Window (second-best film of all time imo)"
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,MovieRules thank you so much for those kind words! Loved seeing your ranking! And your funny comments (I see what you did there with Sabotage). You’ve got a great list!
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,Rewatched Vertigo recently for the first time in 10+ years. Def my fav Hitchcock film and it is def the best movie ever made in my opinion. As much as I love Psycho and North by Northwest it is just on a different level. Stewart and Novak give two of the best performances I've ever seen. 1. Vertigo 2. North by Northwest 3. Psycho 4. Notorious 5. Rear Window 6. Shadow of a Doubt
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"Excellent ranking and so glad you loved Vertigo! It's definitely on it's own level of film making, and I feel like I enjoy it more on every rewatch! It currently hops around as my #3 or #4 Hitchcock film."
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"Overall great list. For the next Hitchcock  I recommend you Frenzy. It's ""R-rated"", but it's worth a watch. It was his last great film. Saboteur and Young and Innocent are two others I enjoy a lot."
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"J G thank you!! I saw the first 30 minutes or so of Sabaoteur 2 years ago but never finished it for some reason. Young and Innocent was actually on my watchlist for this month, but it got pushed off the radar when I put my focus towards his silent films. I’m gonna have a friend filter out the suggestive scenes of Frenzy so I’ll be able to watch it "
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"Yes, Frenzy is excellent, definitely worth watching. Saboteur is good, very similar to North By Northwest, just not as good"
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"i dont dislike family plot,it was never meant to be frenzy,but it has a mr and mrs.smith  classic hitch romcom feel to it,alot of people think his best silent film was the ring,that was hitch romcom,i dont get the feel that hitchcock was trying to do a sorta masterpiece with family plot it was just supposed to be a simple little comedy for most part,doesnt try to be more then it is"
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"if hitchcock had been allowed to make his original idea of kaleidoscope we would have been deprived of john finch's masterful performance in frenzy that character is just caught up in whirlwind kinda like chaplins tramp,sounds like kaleidoscope would have been alot darker,audience would have missed out on brilliant mix of humor mixed with dark plot that makes frenzy masterpiece it is,love the detective and his wife too perfect blend"
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"Frenzy is my favourite. I first watched Young And Innocent last week and thought it was a really good one too, i'm glad that's high on your to watch list."
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,Thanks for making this! It's hard to find videos that go beyond a similar top 10. I'm looking forward to seeing you rank his entire canon.
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,Thank you! Someday!! 
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,I thought Rope was an amazing movie.  I saw the stage play a couple of years ago and then I learned that Hitchcock had made it into a movie in 1948.
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"Thomas Wilke that doesn’t surprise me that it’s a stage play too, I could totally see it being presented in that medium!"
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,Where was the play held?
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo, @Angelo TriNidad  I saw it at the Websters Theatre in Glasgow. It was called “Patrick Hamilton’s Rope.”It was also called Rope’s End in an off Broadway production in New York.
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo, @Thomas Wilke  thank you! Musta been an experience.
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"I have seen all actual movies from Alfred Hitchcock (no old lost shorts and stuff) and i got to say, he is my favorite director. I just love his directing style in so many ways and Rear Window is my favorite film of all time. The master of suspense."
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,Great ranking! My favorites are.1. Rear window 2. Psycho 3. Vertigo4. North by northwest5. Rebecca
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,Rear Window is my favorite Hitchcock film and Torn Curtain is my least favorite. I just couldn't get into Torn Curtain.
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"Awesome ranking my dude. Man half of his films that you ranked I have seen but I have a long way to go to see his rest of his filmography! I really need to see Dial M for Murder, to catch a thief, stranger on a train. Many more. And I approved the message of putting Rear Window at the very top cause is my favorite Alfred Hitchcock film of all time. Anyways keep up and have a good one. -bernardo cisneros"
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,THE MOVIE GEEK Bernardo thank you!! I’m gonna watch your Lifeboat video right now!
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"Just stumbled across this. What a great, fun video! I envy you so much discovering new Hitchcocks. I’ll have to catch up on your reactions and I hope you do another ranking later on."
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"Thank you! Yes I plan to do a ranking of all of his movies on his birthday this year, August 13th!"
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,Seems you haven't seen Topaz and Torn Curtain. Good for you. The two only Hitchcock movies I think are awful. I would recommend Family Plot. It's definitely in my top 5.
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"dido on topaz,torn curtain is watchable,the scene where paul newman is trying to kill the unkillable guy was good"
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"Great video mate! I've seen around 10 films of Hitchcock till date. Really excited to watch and explore more of his films, this video surely will help. Subbed from India :)"
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,Satyarth Singh which one has been your favorite of the ones you have seen?? Welcome to the channel! Thank you for watching :)
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo," @Nathan Hale Classics  Rear Window is my most favorite one, no doubt in that. Psycho being the number two and then Dial M for Murder. These are my top 3."
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,Satyarth Singh great list!!
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,Thanks for the list. I can't wait to watch more Hitchcock movies. Here are my favorites so far.1. Rear Window2. North By Northwest3. Dial M For Murder4. Vertigo5. Strangers On A Train6. To Catch A Thief7. The Lady Vanishes8. The Birds9. Psycho10. Shadow Of A Doubt11. Rope
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"Can’t complain, these are all great movies!"
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"Added a few more to my recent watch list. Young and Innocent (Very good. I have a soft spot for nostalgic black and white movies). Suspicion (Surprisingly good). The Pleasure Garden (Watched a few times before I started to appreciate it). Lifeboat (Good), and finally Marnie (Liked some of the characters but kind of a depressing movie)."
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"Three more added. Saboteur (Pretty good. Kept me entertained). Frenzy ( I saw your comments and I agree with you. I like the older movies set in the 20's, 30's, 40's and 50's.) Notorious (Needed to watch it twice. I liked the characters, but I like Claude Rains and Ingrid Bergman much better in Casablanca)."
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,Recently saw the remake of The Man Who Knew Too Much. I agree with you. It was a fun movie to watch.
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,I Confess is another great movie.
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"Bro, you will love The Saboteur (1942) THAT is amazing and probably his most under appreciated film period"
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,Awesome!! I own it and plan to watch it soon!
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo, @Nathan Hale Classics  very good! I’m looking forward to seeing your thoughts on that
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"My Top 10 would be:The 39 StepsThe Lady VanishesRopeStrangers on a TrainDial ""M"" for MurderRear WindowVertigoNorth by NorthwestPsychoFrenzyOne good advice: never forget to discover and re-discover the british career of Hitchcock"
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"Of the ones you didn't include, I would say Frenzy, Marnie, and Stage Fright are all great."
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"you liked marnie,have you seen movies hitchcock made with gregory peck? sean connery in marnie always reminded me of type of character peck played in spellbound and paradine case,just a little bit of a threat beneath the surface"
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,loved this video! I really need to watch more of Hitchcock's filmography...I've only seen one of his movies 
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,Nicholas thanks Nick! Hey everyone has to start somewhere 
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"I Confess (1953) was the first Hitchcock film I saw, and I haven't seen it since that first time, but I was hooked and I still stink of it as one of my favorites."
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,Just saw it for the time and I loved it!
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"Epic tier! Some of these Hitchcock films I haven't even seen, but I've seen most and he's definitely the best classic director for sure."
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"My number 1 is ""Marnie"". I also like ""The Family Plot"" a lot."
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,Really one of a kind. Amazing video. I’ve only seen 17. Rope is definitely my favorite.
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"Just saw Rope for the first time, I've putted off watching it for years...Man what a great film! So glad I finally saw it"
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"The one omission would be Frenzy. It's commonly regarded as Hitchcock's only good ""late"" movie. Would you be able to include your ranking in the description (either as a link or a bullet-pointed list)? Thanks for the video!"
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"My favorite is Frenzy. You don't mention it also Marnie, Torn Curtain, Topaz, the Paradine Case, Jamaica Inn(his all time worst), the Family Plot, Strangers on a Train, the Lady Vanishes, these are among Hitchcock's best films."
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"Wow. I just found your channel. I remember your old channel when I was like 10 years old, when you ranked all of the Harry Potter books. Love your content man."
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,I really enjoyed Frenzy. A great film at the end of the master's career!
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"i'm always interested in how people rank hitchcock films and the reasoning behind their choices. I was surprised at how high you placed ""the wrong man,"" as i have always thought this was one of the director's rare misfires, especially considering that the wrong man as a chief motivating plot point is one of hithcock's most consistently recurring themes.i also have been watching with interest the rising esteem in which ""rope"" has been held in the past few years. hitchcock himself more or less dismissed it as a gimmick that didn't pay off, and that still seemed to be the critical consensus when it was given a brief theatrical reissue back in the 1980s, along with a handful of other hitchcock films that universal was about to release on home video for the first time. that was the first time that i saw it, and was immediately struck by what an effective, absorbing and even daring and  disturbing piece of filmmaking it is. maybe it was just waiting for its time to come around."
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,You’re the best! Love your Hitchcock love
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"Torn Curtain definitely doesn’t get the love I think it deserves. Very underrated of his filmography, maybe even the one that I think is MOST underrated from him. I’ll be very curious of your take on it once you get around to watching it. While it may not end up on your Poifect rank, I can see it between Great and Nearly Poifect."
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"Frenzy and Family Plot are underrated movies of his. Yes, it's an older Hitchcock but still worth watching."
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,This month inspired me to maybe do my own director month keep up the good work on your videos
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,I’ve only seen 2 Hitchcock movies so here’s my ranking of them 1. Psycho and 2. The birds
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,Hitchcock directed his first movie in Germany 
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,Of those i've seen so far these are my top 10:10 Jamaica Inn9 The Birds8 Rear Window7 Strangers On A Train6 Young And Innocent5 Family Plot4 Rope3 Dial M For Murder2 Psycho1 Frenzy
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,"This is amazing!But I'm sorry to disappoint you but you will probably never see every hitchcock film, since his 'The Mountain Eagle' is a lost one, unfortunately."
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,Marnie i'd put on the short list to watch.
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,Hitchcock’s Movies pull you in immediately....Just right away.....He had a great sense of humor also....Very hard to pick top for me! Valerie Craft Kitover
hitchcock movies recommend,eo5WyB70Zzo,Foreign Correspondent is so underrated.

Elizabeth Harvest8. The Invitation7. We Summon the Darkness6. What Keeps You Alive5. Super Dark Times4. The Platform3. The Occupant2. Burning1. The Invisible Guest Honorable Mentions - 1BR, The Perfection"
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,I watched all  of these this weekend and The invisible guest was hands down the most intriguing of the bunch. I see why it was ranked # on this list. I have never seen so many plot twists and angles each getting crazier than the last. It had me guessing until the very end. I highly recommend this movie!
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,But it’s not in English
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,"Burning is one of those movies that's up there with Cyclo. Loved it. The invisible guest just became a must see after your description. Recovering from an appendicitis I can use some more material to watch, but I have to go easy on the knives pointing at bellies images...Thank you Darren!"
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,I’ll spend 30+minutes looking through movies to pick the right one because I don’t want to waste 2 hours of my life. Darren hasn’t failed me yet. 👍🏽👍🏽
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,Looking forward to checking some of these out. The only two I have already seen on this list are The Invitation and Super Dark Times - both are incredible.
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,"Hey man, you do a really good job of explaining things in a way that makes the film sound interesting but not really giving much away of the story as to ruin it!"
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,This list was spot on! So many good movies you have selected and especially having The Invisible Guest as your #1 spot was absolute perfection.
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,Thanks Jessica
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,Elizabeth Harvest was so predictable I figured it out in the first scene. The way I got what the film was about was the title and the way they filmed the main actress. We summon the darkness was also highly predictable. That movie was predictable because it falls into Hollywood’s new tropes. So brave and bold is predictable and expected. I view these tropes like password criteria when hacking.
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,I watched the Invisible Guest awhile ago but rewatched it with my hubby I didn’t give any hints or spoilers...he was blown away at how good it was. And yes it’s a “Hitchkockian” kind of movie. I loved it. Tried last night to watch “Burning” but it starts out so slow we couldn’t keep our eyes open. Will give it another try maybe Saturday afternoon and not nighttime.
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,"Good list, a couple for me to add to my list (Invisible Guest and The Occupant).  I really loved the Invitation, but I have to say that I hated The Perfection...and I don't say that often."
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,"I absolutely loved 1 BR. I'm so glad you added it to the list!!! And the Perfection I think was brilliant. I just couldn't believe what was going on until that first flashback, I'm like WTF?"
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,I was pleasantly surprised with 1BR. Can’t wait to see what that director and the lead actress do next.
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI, @CorbCorbin  me too. I thought I was just killing time with something on in the background and I ended up actually watching it and really enjoying it
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,"Incredible list. Seen most of them, but looking forward to checking out Elizabeth Harvest and the Invisible Guest. Super Dark Times is awesome... you ever hear that fan theory about who the... ah... “real” mastermind behind all the events is? It’s wild, but also kind of fits. Gives two awesome and completely different ways of watching it."
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,"I've watched The Invitation, What Keeps You Alive, The Platform, The Occupant, The Perfection and The Invisible Guest. All great movies, all great reccomendations!! The Invisible Guest is my personal favourite too, a real masterpiece. I'm looking forward to watch Burning, 1BR, Elizabeth Haverst and Berlin Syndrome."
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,I enjoy foreign films so much more than Hollywood films because US films tend to be so derivative so The Invisible Guest is my most anticipated movie.
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,As always you have the exact same taste as me the occupant was so creepy I’ve loved 6 more. As always thank you so much for being the channel who actually writes out a list to screenshot 🙏

twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,"Thank You for the list,  I prefer to watch knowing little as possible. Let the story unfold , presenting itself as intended . Same with books."
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,Ahhh man I was about to watch Berlin syndrome last night and  for some reason I got distracted well I genus I'll be resuming play
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,I wish he would do this in the description
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,Thank you kind sir.
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,Marcel Pete He does. In the top comment.
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,"Darren please do a Shudder list soon! Halloween is coming and I honestly never know what is going to be good on there, the stars don't always line up with the actual quality, kinda like Prime. I trust your recommendations more than anyone else. Thanks man, I hope you see this!"
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,There's a Facebook group I'm in called Shudder Horror Fans. Great group that recommends all the good movies on there!
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI, @Shayna Thompson  Thank you!
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,"Put ""Burning"" and ""The Invisible Guest"" on my list last night! Looking forward to watching them. Great list, DVD, thanks!"
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,The Invisible Guest is really a good one
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,Watched it cause of this comment and I gotta say that was a good one
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,"Just watched the invisible guest and it was brilliant. Soooo many twists and turns. My big hunch was correct which normally sucks, but it was more of a cherry on top that didn’t ruin it. Great recommendation."
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,What Keeps You Alive could be flip flopped with Super Dark Times. Super Dark Times had one of the most brilliant and spooky and scant dream sequences I ever seen in a movie. But What Keeps You Alive was way more adventurous and more sequences that were believable.
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,"Since I've subscribed to your channel I've now become a supporter of subtitles. There use to be a time where if a movie had them it was a big no! That being said the invisible guest, burning and the witch/subversion.  SPOT ON  my friend. Spot on!!!"
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,If you haven’t watched “The Wailing” yet you need to get on it ASAP.  Best horror/ thriller movie I’ve seen in a long time and the subtitles were easy to follow.
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,"The invisible guest was okay for me, because when the story started to unravel and the mistress went to the old guys house , as soon as i saw his wife, i already knew what was going to happen, so i stopped watching it and couple weeks after that my friends was watching it i got to watch with them til the end, why are people so surprised? like HOW?"
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,"The Invisible Guest is a great film, all of  Oriol Paulo films are well worth a watch, but particularly The Body if you enjoy The Invisible Guest"
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,"Thanks Darren. The Invisible Guest was a cracking 'whodunnit', very much in the Agatha Christie style, Miss Marples only stranger and more suspenseful and harder edged. Excellent!"
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,"Super Dark Times is actually one of my favorite films, is that weird? It’s like a really good book that you think about all the time, beautifully done."
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,I watched the burning after you recommended it!  What a superb film. Now I will check out the invisible guest next. Thanks for all your reviews and top 10 lists!
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,Ooooh man!!! The Invisible Guest was fantastic!  Your description nailed it too.  If Hitchcock was still around that'd be his movie.  I was not expecting it to be good and was outstanding.
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,In regards to Elizabeth Harvest this movie reminded me of an old fairy tale about a young woman who married a King 🤴 and in his castle 🏰 was 1 room she was forbidden to enter and when she did it went very bad for her.
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,I watched both 1BR and We Summon The Darkness from this video and loved them both (1BR being the stand out for me). Thanks again for the recommendations!
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,"LOVED ""The Perfection"", thanks for the previous recommendation. If that is an honorable mention I'm gonna have to give these a try! 👍👍"
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,Hey it’s been a while but you are still my favorite movie reviewer. Been sick so I have not been doing much but watching movies. Going to take a Chance on The Invisible Guest. I have seen most of the others. Keep going with the intense movies. Love them!
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,The Invitation was a total mind-f!@k movie and Soo good! There was nothing I didn't like about it and a gut punch ending! Great  list!
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,the invitation was such a great movie. the perfection was great also. we summon the darkness looks cool. the platform looks good but i wish it was in english. 1 BR looks good. and the invisible guest looks pretty good also.
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,I love all your lists so when I saw the title of today's video I was super stoked! I just got done watching The Invisible Guest...very epic twist and turns awesome recommendation again!
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,"LOVED all of these! Can't wait for Neflix, HULU or PRIME to add ""High Tension"", that F*cked up movie certainly belongs on a list like this one."
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,Great list Darren. I’ve seen some of these but have some new stuff to watch❤️
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,I have actually never heard of any of these.  I am looking forward to watching the whole list.  Thanks!
twisted ending movies recommend,vZXNJ9ALFaI,"I just watched 1BR like two days ago , didn't care for it. They needed to explain why or how the neighbors became a cult and who they are working for. Berlin syndrome and super dark times were good films. Hated the invitation. Way too slow and didn't pick up until like the last 20 mins of the film. Some good recommendations though."

twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo, @SilverCube  that movie was way better then I thought it was going to be. It exceeded my expectations!
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,I watched this movie with my mom.  We both figured out both twists before they were revealed. It's a great movie. My mom also figured out both of the Shutter Island twists before they were revealed the first time she saw it.  I had already seen the film before. She paused the movie after about 30 minutes and asked me if it was a suspense movie.  Once she knew it was. She figured out what was going to happen.

twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo, @Asifity  my pleasure 🙏
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,I’m sorry how is Tony Stark offering Peter a spot in The Avengers a “PLOT TWIST???”
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"Nah, that wasn't the twist. It was that Peter DECLINED the offer that was the twist."
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo," @tcrpgfan  That wasn't twisty enough, either."
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,Aunty may finds out Peter is actually Spiderman... Thats more appropriate option
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,I would've been fine if they just said Adrian Tooms was liz's dad.
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,Marvel is predictable.
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,They make her younger every time.
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,Considering most of the marvel heros are part of the Avengers he was obviously going to ask him to join. The plot twist would have been who he didn't want to be an Avenger
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,I mean that's not really a plot twist because they sprung it on us.
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo," @tcrpgfan  this ""twist"" could have been left out of the list."
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo, @Atomic Scizor  it is more exposing
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,Repeat with me: “a revelation is not always a plot twist”.
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,This is exactly how I feel about parasite’s “pLoT tWiSt”
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo, @Anthony Hernandez  what about Spiderman? I'm also sick of people saying that the end of Infinity War was a plot twist. Pfff.
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,It  ever is. A.plot twist  is a plot twist  a reveal is a reveal. How many times do they get this wrong
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"a revelation can be a plot twist, yet not all revelations are plot twists"
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo, @Obi  Exactly. Thats why I said “is not ALWAYS a plot twist”
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo," @o b  Thank you! It was building to that. What else was going to happen? We knew there was another movie to come. Also, for me, the blipping of Peter Parker, while well acted, had no tension since we all knew there was another Spiderman movie to come out. He was going to come back."
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"Zootopia (2016)- The nighthowlers aren't wolves, they're flowers- Bellwether was the villain."
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,This is the one i was willing to comment and apparently zootopia is one of my favorite movies. ❤️
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,I went to the movies to see it and I remember absolutely none of it whatsoever 😅😏
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"The movie The Others traumatized me as a child. Still scares the HELL out of me. Sylvia Browne was right about one thing... we are the dead ones, the spirits are the ones who are alive."
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,I love The Others.
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,Coco: when Miguel and Hector realize Ernesto is a murderer and when they later realize they are related.
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,That shit was DEEP
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,Yes bro. Never saw that shit coming
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,It was crazy how you kinda suspected it but midway was like oh nevermind then it hits you and Pikachu face
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,Neither of those are plot twists
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo, @TB - 1497  yes they are
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,Good call on this one.
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,Yes man I watched that movie not too long ago and I absolutely loved it
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo, @TB - 1497  if that’s not a plot twist please share whatever you believe plot twist means
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"There’s another twist that never seems to get mentioned; Coco loves her father.The movie starts by implying that Coco hates Hector for three reasons: 1) she lives in a family where hatred is expected, 2) she was raised by a woman who hated Hector with a burning passion, and 3) how could Coco feel anything but disgust for the man who abandzoned her? Towards the end of the film, the family discover that Coco actually loves her father, and it’s her memories that have kept him alive. Although I keep wondering why the living family don’t question this more...100 years of safety and tradition out the window and no one has anything to say? 🤔"
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,'Vertigo' and 'The Usual Suspects' absolutely should be on this list!
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,Definitely Usual Suspects
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"""Knives Out"" is soooooo good! Saw it in the cinema, then watched it with my bro when he watched it for the first time on Netflix, then I got it on DVD and watched it a number of times again since 😅"
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,The best part of that movie is when Chris Evans' arms were about to bust out of that white sweater he was wearing in that scene in the restaurant!😂
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,Loved it.Chris Evans lit the movie far better than Craig did.
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,Didn't expect it. I loved that film so much
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,Definitely a movie to watch a few times!
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,YEAH I LOVED IT!!
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo," @C V Nair  Both did good job, I never thought I would see James Bond being a detective and his dialect was the best and Evans was totally not Captain America, both did great ~"
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,Wait whaaat..? it was on Netflix?
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"Watching ""Us,"" ""The Others,"" and ""The Mist"" for me definitely hit the ground running for multiple plot twists, which I learned long ago can really be fascinating and terrifying all at once. And, also, make you do a double take and make you question ""What the hell have I been doing all this time?"""
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"Joker:1. He was never actually dating his apartment neighbor. 2. Instead of killing himself on tv, he killed the show host."
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"I get that he practiced the joke and did shoot in the routine every time but, you genuinely expected him to kill himself at the end ?"
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo, @Jared Layne  I didn’t know what to expect.
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo, @Justin Goldberg  I think the second one you said was better but that’s valid
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo," @Scott Summers  he was in his apartment practicing to go on the show. At the end of each “rehearsal”, he pretended to shoot himself in the face."
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"Ehh. If you're familiar with the character on any level, you'd know right away that the first twist was plausible and that he would never kill himself unless it would entertain himself or as a part of a joke. Hence why they're not shocking."
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"How about the biggest twist of all. NONE of this in the movie actually happened.  He made the whole thing up during a session with his counselor at the end.  Nothing before him talking to her is real, n prolly the scene after too.   In the middle of the movie there is a quick cutscene of him banging his head against a asylum wall. Thats one of the first clues.  Jokers origin is unknown, in fact he makes up different versions bc he doesnt even remember (like in the Dark Knight or Killing Joke)   At the end when the doctor asks whats so funny, that's what he means by ""you'd  never get it""I mean being bruce wayans half brother and causing his parents death, leading to create batman?  Only someone as twisted as mr j could make that up in his head."
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"if none of these happened then there's no villain in batman series, movies and etc... Right?"
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo, @Angel Helle Godinez  wrong.  this movie is not  cannon to any batman lore. this was stated early on that it was a stand a lone concept movie and not part of any dc universe
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"Get Out had 3 twists, the family literally auctions their body. (Not a big twist) his gf, Rose, is the one who sets them up, that was the real twist, then yea the ending, it was his friend and not the real cops"
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"I was all for ""The Others"" ever since it came out. I remember it came out on DVD and I was living in A. Korea, well a group of women that I was cool with watched it and ran out of the room scared. Nobody used the restroom alone that night."
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"The Mist made me cry at the end, and The Others blew my freaking mind when I first saw it. I haven't seen all the movies on this list - def have to check them out. Midsommar also is a good one!"
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,I wouldn't consider some of these plot twists. I think a plot twist is when a piece of information is revealed that changes the audience's assumptions of the reality of the story up until that point.
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,Exactly. Something like Peter refusing Tony is not at all a plot twist.
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo, @Mony  omg that’s on thwre
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"""Plot twist"" has kind of become one of those terms like ""plot hole"" that is just so ridiculously overused that it's pretty much lost all meaning by this point. For the record, you're absolutely right about what a plot twist actually is. I'd say about only half of the things mentioned in this list qualify as genuine plot twists and, ironically, most of them are in the 20-10 numbers. The rest are just a mix of ""didn't see that coming"" and character development (like the ""Peter refusing Tony"" example) which aren't necessarily the same thing as a plot twist."
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo, @Mony  yeah it’s not a plot twist
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,This video has a real tendency to conflate murder with a plot twist
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo," @Akshay 004  totally agree with you,some movies on these list are not quite twist more of a revelation.Movies you mention like the inception that twist was sick!same with intersellar !also add movie Oblivion ."
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo," @Akshay 004  that terrifies me !a classic that doesn’t requires a multiple plot twist because the plot self itself is quite disturbing and shocking,knowing that he was dead all the time."
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"Yeah I agree with this. Like Psycho I would definitely consider a plot twist. Marion Crane being murdered is kinda twisty but I think its more so shock. Finding out Norman Bates was the killer and was posing as his mother, who he actually murdered along with her lover, THATS a twist."
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"The Prestige is my favorite movie. The characters are intentionally named Alfred Borden and Robert Angier. ABRA, as in ABRACADABRA. The Cadabra is the movie itself, the prestige. Great film."
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,That was a great movie
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,I've watched that movie probably 20 times and I can realize and accept that it's good but for some reason my brain just will not comprehend the twist. I just can't figure the movie out. Help?
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo, @Jessica Blakeslee  The movie was designed to be a magic trick itself. Just when you think you have the movie figured out...BOOM! The Prestige. What are you struggling with?
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"The most shocking double twist I've seen is from ""Primal Fear "" starring Edward Norton and Richard Gere"
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,I don't think primal fear twist was that shocking it was amazing but wasn't shocking. You can guess it.
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,Yessss
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,THERE S NO AARON
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,This film is absolutely brilliant
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,Yes. Sooo good.
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"How the hell is 'Wild Things' not on this list. Sure, it wasn't on the same level as the other movies on this list, but it had several great twists right until the end."
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,I’m curious to know if anyone thinks of PrimalFear as a movie with a double twist. I think it qualifies :)
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"Clue should've made this list. First twist everyone who died was an accomplice, and second twist 3 different people could've been the murderer. And maybe strangers on a train"
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,As soon as I saw the title I immediately thought of “The Usual Suspects”“The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn’t exist” -Keyser Soze
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"I'm very surprised you didn't even mention some OBVIOUS choices for this title - The Village (2004), Alien (1979), Sleepaway Camp (1983), Happy Birthday to Me (1981), Tenebre (1982), Searching (2018), A Perfect Getaway (2009), The House of the Laughing Windows (1976), The Life of David Gale (2003), L.A. Confidential (1997), Side Effects (2013), Black Christmas (1974), Escape Plan (2013)"
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,Saw 2 had more plot twists than swiss cheese had holes. It was my favorite movie from the 2000s and still is one of my favorites today. There was so many plot twists for a modern day horror film definitely ahead of its time.
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"A definite addition to this list should be  Behind Her Eyes, which had about two at least. It definitely threw me for a loop, not once but twice!! I was like, ""Are you for real?! Nooo!"""
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"He isn’t about to turn the gun on himself in The Mist, he was out of rounds."
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,they actually forgot a little movie called Identity in which has two twist and the second one wasn't as strong but still shocking
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"The mist: he wasn't about to turn the gun on himself, he knew there wasn't enough bullets so they all decided he was going to kill everyone else then die at the hands of the monster. Its said as if he murdered them. Plot twists are great if they're told correctly."
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,Spiderman: Homecoming's plot twist with who Liz's father was is one of the greatest moments in the entire MCU. The entire audience gasped in the theater :)
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"YES! Scream ranked!  I think this just confirms as further proof how iconic & important Scream is & will forever be.  Also, I've seen  like 17 or 18 of these"
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,Murder on the Orient Express.Self explanatory.And more than one murderer.
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"They forgot to add Primal Fear, Fight Club, Star Wars: Emire Strikes Back, and Sixth Sense to the list."
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"The ending to The Mist absolutely broke my heart. Had they literally waited another 5 minutes, they ALL could've been saved. 💔😔"
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,Knives out was really good. The puking joke was brilliantly used.
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,The Others was a great film that ending was brilliant and well played out
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,They should've included the lego movie 2. The two plot twists are the queen was originally a heart created by Emmet and Rex was Emmet from the future and the real villain.
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"In 'The Mist' David isn't ""about to turn the gun on himself"" when the military shows up. He actually gets far enough to attempt shooting himself, but the gun ends up being out of bullets."
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,Knives out at 20. It should be at least top 3. Best movie of the year. Loved it.
twisted ending movies recommend,Invd_f70bdo,"Also- in the mist- David should have gone with the lady that asked if someone could walk her home to get her kids from earlier in the movie, but nobody stepped up so she left on her own and ended up making it safely outta town alive, with her children. I always though that was a crazy plot twist!"
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,I feel like Neil Breen HAS to be an alien who learned about human interaction from bad 70s scifi movies.

twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,this is like one of those weird ass dreams that seem completely normal in the moment but make no sense when you wake up
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,"omg right, like yeah you're not lucid enough to be like wait this can't happen, but you're lucid enough for there to be a shard of a storyline. god I had one last night woke up in a cold sweat"
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,I think you may be right. Maybe Breen had dreams (Breen dreams) thought they were great and just wrote a script and here we are. In fact the same for all his movies.
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,"tfw my dreams are always like that. Friends and family in real life aren't themselves in dreams. My spouse is the opposite gender and a different race, my children morph into animals, hell at a lot of points animals and humans morph into one another; places seep into each other, like my old jobs aren't them, I stead they're my home mixed eith the building, or school or a mixture of all 3. I'll be in one ""scene"" and it just changes to another but also just morphs or seeps into another until it's completely different. I don't know how dreams are supposed to be, but my spouse tells me none of that is normal."
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY, @Cat eat china  Who else is to say what’s normal in dreams? To me this is fairly normal but my dreams (mainly nightmares) are strange and trippy too (in a different way). It’s wholly subjective and you’re totally fine.
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY," @Cats In Space  I have never talked to anyone else about my dreams and how they're structured (or lack of), so I don't really know what's ""normal"". He's a weirdo, as the few dreams he remembers he says they're almost like waking life and he mostly dreams about work. That sounds like a bummer. Tbh I dream a lot about my old jobsz which I kiss dearly. I haven't worked in 6 years :( What you said makes sense about dreams being subjective, though. 😁"
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY," @Cat eat china  Aww he isn’t a weirdo either, we’re all different. Some of us (like me and you) have trippy dreams, some are boring and some people never even remember them or have them. But yeah if you wanna see other people’s dreams look around the internet for groups or subreddits. You can even try learn to control them either to an extent or totally. Lucid dreaming is fun. It’s a fascinating subject. :D Thanks for sharing your experiences."

twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,Beautiful
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,I’m literally crying at this lol 10/10
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,Lox
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,Why isnt this pinned?
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY, @Langrow  that’s a good one 😆
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,Atleast the bagel isn’t cut in a möbius strip or Danny is gonna loose it
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,Cody ko: who got bagels?
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,I get the feeling that Neil is making these movies to express his hatred of computers and laptops
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,Phucking love your name and pfp
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,I actually laughed out loud
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,this whole movie is literally like a meme someone would make
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,That's why Neil Breen is God
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,"I’m the 1,000th like."
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,notblondeswede yes omg esto1121 love him
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,This whole movie is literally a meme I would make
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,cat mccormick Maybe Neil made it that way on purpose and it IS a meme. We’re just not on the same wavelength as his genius 😪.
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,Yes
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,as opposed to a meme not made by someone? tf
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,Memes are at a higher level many times
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,"""everyone has the right to love in peace""neil really said lgbtq rights"
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,I can’t get over how all of Neil Breen’s lines are delivered with a completely flat tone and with no discernible emotion on his face 😂😂
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,"Movie studio executives: ""what is the projected budget for this film?""Neil: ""how much does a pack of menthol cost nowadays? Whatever it is, the budget is about 2 packs."""
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,Damn homeboy really made a rough draft of a script and then made it into a movie. No in between
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,"what's with this guy and forcing romantic interests to get together with him, only to kill them afterwards?"
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,"It’s kinda cute to imagine that he probably had a solid idea for this film, but just struggled to make it real. I wonder what the whole thing looks like in his head. It could be quite decent."
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,“Programmable virtual reality. The corrupted version.” Isn’t that just a broken headset
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,"Honestly Neil Breen dresses like my lesbian aunt. No hate, he just does."
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,Neil’s monologues sound like he’s describing boomer memes without seeing the image
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,It's really hard to believe Kurtis didn't edit that break up scene
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,imagine this movie but with the most famous hollywood actors.that would be 10 times funnier
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,“i don’t have what you have”“but you could’ve”has the same energy as“i should’ve left you on that street corner where you were standing”“but cha didnt”
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,Story ark: Kale is a serial killerKade never had a beard
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,"""where's he BREEN?"" is the kind of humor we subscribe for."
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,"hey kurtis, i know that you probably won’t see this but thanks for putting the sexual assault tw, i hate it when people show things so traumatic to some and don’t have any indication so just wanted to you let you know that that’s actually such an amazing thing to do :)"
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,“I don’t have what you have” “But you could’ve” Is un ironically the most masterful usage of the English language.
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,"i know im a year late watching this video, but why did i look this movie up and imdb says the budget was $3 im crying 🤣🤣🤣"
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,“Programmable virtual reality”...yep. That’s what’s VR is.
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,"the skit of kurtis just rising out of nowhere and saying ""programmable matter"" with a straight face gets me every time"
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,"i will pay all my money for Kurtis to recreate the entire movie starring him, Danny and drew."
twisted ending movies recommend,FrZ-5xrj1dY,Him jumping off buildings with explosions in the background is me  pretending to do parkour in Creative mode
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,"When Jigsaw stood up at the end of Saw, that blew my mind.  A reveal so simple, but so effective, it was amazing.Knowing he could hear the other 2 in the room the whole time trying to figure things out , it was amazing. Literally gave himself the perfect front row seat"
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,"I made my Mrs watch ""The Descent"" the night before we went caving for the first time. it made for an immersive experience the next day..."
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,How freaked out did she keep getting during the trip?
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY," @Shea Welman  I was nervous of getting  an axe through my head..., maybe I should have chosen some other trip for our wedding anniversary"
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,Oh you’re mean😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY, @Twiggymaster666  of that there is no doubt...
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY, @Kelly Stephenson  nods
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,"Yeah, not a trip I’d take after this one LoL your wife is very brave!"

twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY, @Vor Freude  i yelled at myself for letting me watch it!!
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,“We’ve talked about the Mist too much”Talks about The Descent
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,And right after mentioning Cabin in the woods.
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,"""So instead, let's talk about the OTHER dead horse we've beaten so hard it's now a horse-shaped crater, The Descent."""
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,Talks about the Skeleton key
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,666 likes?
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,Could have easily Brought up room 1408 with its FOUR FUCKING ENDINGS
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY, @Ol' Dee  who hurt you lol also I'm a guy so what's flat champ
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,"Thank you, lol."
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,my thoughts exactly. This channel is putting this movie on almost every list...
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY, @FALLING DOWN THE STAIRS ALL DAY Joseph Pyles   um you do know with a e spelled Brooke is the female version of the name and without is the male version right also how does that have anything to do with anything we were talking about
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,Fun fact about sleep away camp’s ending: It actually scared the actor for Pete. I deeply hope he’s doing well
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,he was deeply traumatized and never acted again. it even went so far that no one knows how the actor looks like
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,I didnt know this. I love that ending
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,I had found out about the aftermath of this movies from watching @deadmeats kill count. Pretty messed up.
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,The boy Peter didn’t actually play Peter;  he was only in the one scene with the Aunt with the bandages on his head. The one who played Angela was a woman named Felissa Rose and I’ve met her and the one who played the boy at the end is an 18-year-old actor stand in with a life mask of Felissa .
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,"Is he sick or something? It's not cancer, is it? Screech Powers aka Dustin Diamond has it. I hope he's doing well."
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY, @HolyGuacamole  no the ending traumatized him
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY, @Donnie The slayer  Are you talking about PTSD or sleeping with the lights on for a couple of nights? That's way too vague.
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY, @HolyGuacamole  ptsd
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY, @Donnie The slayer  😬
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY, @Donnie The slayer  so what happened to traumatise him that bad
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,"Eden Lake, Hereditary, Midsommar, and The Witch. I love slow burns and endings that either seem plausible in the real world or a little supernatural but in common fears. It makes it more real and therefore scary."
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,“The Mist” seriously depresses me and “drag me to hell” it seriously bums me out. I love 70s and 80s horror. My boyfriend does not but “sleepaway  camp” definitely surprised him.
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,"""The Mist"" made me feel like laughing and crying; it was just so incredibly stupid and laughable how his family had to die because he didn't wait a few minutes, and it was depressing once he realizes if only, if only he had waited, then everything would be fine and he wouldn't have lost anything"
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY," @tunamayo   ........,"
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,Hell yeah sleepaway camp was so fun
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY," @Lemon Demon  now, sacrificing yourself to save others is commendable. and the earth is stationary and flat."
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,Ye
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY," @Lemon Demon  no, the earth is a disk/circle, not a ball."
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,"Drag Me to Hell really bothered me. The idea that some random lady has the power to sentence a soul to an eternity of hell for literally no reason (it wasn't even the character's fault the loan was denied, she couldn't have helped the lady) was just evil to me. There was no justice, one victim was punished by another victim in the cruelest possible way."
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY," @Christopher Parks  yeah the whole concept of hell is unimaginably dark and evil. No-one deserves infinite punishment for a finite crime, no matter how large it is. Especially when the ""crime"" was just doing you job, or in the case of the child at the start just stealing something.But I guess the point of Horror is to present awful situations to us where justice rarely happens."
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,"Ash: We talk about the Mist too muchAlso Ash: Aaaaand at number one, The Descent."
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,I agree
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY," @Martin Ward  I agree. The Descent, in every damn list."
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY, @Ollie Smith  The decent is fine movie but it doesn't have a really scary trist there just being lazy at this point
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,"Not just mentioning ""The Descent"" but ""THE UK ENDING IS SO MUCH BETTER BECAUSE IT'S THE REAL ONE AND WE CAN'T COPE WITH THE AMERICAN ENDING!!!!!!"""
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,And Drag Me to Hell.
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,It’s like how all South Park videos feature cartman feeding Scott tenerman his parents
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,7 movies that Whatculture Horror won’t stop making lists about
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,The twist ending in SAW by far was the best for me. Truly unexpected and very clever.
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,This video actually made me want to watch The Borderlands. Absolutely terrified me especially the ending. It's an underrated little gem.
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,"I love Skeleton Key, watching it the 2nd time after you know the twist is almost like watching another movie. The dialogue and flashbacks take on a whole new sinister meaning."
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,"You bet we'd think that the #1 would be ""The mist"" but we've talked about that too much so instead we're going with ... ""The descent""? Because THAT one you haven't talked about too much? Seriously, Ash, if one were to randomly close one's eyes and pick one of your clips at random, chances are that ""The descent"" would be present in some way, shape or form. It's THE most frequently reoccurring movie in the entire WhatCulture clipfest."
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,That's because The Descent is the best adventure horror since Creature from the Black Lagoon.
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,I thought buried with Ryan Reynolds would have been here. Talk about giving us that hope that he was gonna make it then snatch it from us. That ending stays with you.
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,"Ryan Reynolds said his mother turned to him at the end of ""Buried"" and simply said, ""How dare you."""
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,Dude I’m 100% with you. It also showcased what a terrific actor Ryan is
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,"That film, never again. The horror is just how real it is."
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,"Just when I'd forgotten about that film, thanks for reminding me! 🙈"
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,"Well, it wasn't really original. The Dutch film ""Vanished"" (also made in a US version) had the same ending decades ago."
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY," @Borneo Man  Eh, but I liked Buried more.......................Vanished had some good moments but it was too boring for me overall.  (And the US version was crap)."
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY," @David L  I agree with the US version, but the Dutch version scarred me (yes, I spelled that right) for life."
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY," @Borneo Man  Yes, I DO agree it's pretty damn harrowing!  I have seen far WORSE thrillers, I'll admit--overall it's a pretty decent one.................I'll just say it's really good, not great, IMHO."
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,The Descent was the first rated R horror movie I watched by myself and I loved every minute of that horrifying experience! Special place in my heart for sure
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,The Skeleton key ending was really depressing and  extremely unfair/frustrating
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,"Eden Lake left me very disturbed. Much like the Descent, just when you thought the protagonist was safe and away... well, let's just not spoil it for those who haven't seen it but it gave new meaning to the saying, ""out of the frying pan, into the fire."" :O"
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,"Eden lake! Good call, that movie is too real and the ending makes my blood freeze every time!"
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,What happens
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,"Eden lake, I haven't seen it yet...👍🏻"
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,The ending of Dead and Buried creeped me out. Dead Silence also was a little freaky at the end.
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,Buried had me shook at a kid
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,"Tusk man. If I was that guy, I would have tried to ice myself or let the person ice me."
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,"On the surface, it's such a comedic plot. Crazy guy tries to turn someone into a walrus. But then you see HOW he does it and it's utterly horrific. Using the guy's own surgically removed bones for the tusks? Good lord!"
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY, @TheBlues32  And it’s so sad that he’s just stuck that way forever
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,Yea the end Tusk was incredibly unsettling
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,The tear trickling down his cheek…
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,That movie fucked me up for like a week.
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,I couldn't take anything in Drag me to Hell seriously but I did feel bad for the the couple at the end.
twisted ending movies recommend,qTLVxepnbSY,7.Drag me to Hell6. The skeleton key5. The Boardland4. Sleepaway camp3. Saw 2. The cabide Wood1. The Descent

movies for kids recommend,rBDDcN-tkvM,"Very inspirational! Thanks for sharing. What follows is the text of my all time favorite children’s and young adult fictional fish story with an unexpected surprise ending with a lesson learned in kindness and caring.loved by adults of all ages and soon to be a featured animation with illustrations audible and music. Titled “ The Fish Whose Wish Came True”“The Fish Whose Wish Came True”~~   There was once a 10 year old boy named Johnny who lived with his parents in a beautiful home on a lake.   Johnny had everything a boy could want. He ate the finest foods and wore only the most expensive clothes. He also had many toys and pets-Johnny's parents were wealthy - and being an only child, they bought him almost anything he wanted to make him happy.   But Johnny was only happy when he was teasing others.   When he stepped on his cats tail, he would laugh. He also liked to hold his turtle upside down and grab his dog by its flappy ears.Johnny thought, ""Tomorrow I'm going fishing. Then I can really have some fun!""   The next morning was perfect for fishing. The lake was calm which meant the fish were more likely to bite. Johnny loved to go fishing because then he could tease all the fish that he caught.   Johnny placed some bait on his hook and cast out the line.   Johnny didn't have to wait long before he felt a tug on his rod. “ Oh boy, a fish! I’m going to have fun with this one,” he said. He reeled it in and pulled his line clear out of the water and saw a little fish dangling at the end of his hook.He swung the fish close to his face where he could watch it.   Johnny started laughing as the fish wiggled on the hook.   Johnny began poking the fish with his fingers. The fish looked at Johnny as if to say, ""I wish you knew how it feels to be caught on a hook.”But Johnny kept laughing and teasing, teasing and laughing.   Finally, Johnny removed the hook from the fish's mouth and was about to toss it into his bucket when he slipped and lost his balance—and landed on the floor of the wooden dock. As he fell, he was forced to let go of his fishing pole and when he did, the hook became loose... and landed right in Johnny's curly hair!   ""Ouch!” cried Johnny, because the hook was tangled in his hair.Johnny was able to grab his fishing line and began jerking and pulling forwards and backwards, backwards and forwards again and again—but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t free the hook from his curly hair. He tried to wiggle and shake his head sideways like a fish but the more Johnny struggled, the more his hair got tangled in the hook.   He was like a fish caught on his own fishing rod."" Help me!, Help me!“ Johnny yelled, hoping his mother would hear but she was still asleep and his father had already left for work so there was no one around to offer help.He didn't know what to do.With one last effort, he decided to jerk his head upwards several times and as he did, the hook finally loosened...and fell out of his hair and onto the dock.Johnny was so happy to be free that he jumped for joy!But then he remembered the little fish he had teased. It was lying on the dock barely able to breathe.Johnny picked up the fish and gently cupped it in his hands. ""Now I know how it feels to be caught on a hook,” said Johnny. “From now on I’m not going to tease or hurt anyone else. I’m going to treat everyone like I would like them to treat me.”   And with those words, he gently tossed the fish back into the water.   And Johnny walked away with a little less hair that day... but a lot more love in his heart.-Al Fogel***Advance Critical Acclaim:“ “Remarkable! Destined  to become an instant classic and perennial best seller for decades to come” —Albert Azulay, book review critic. “Clever and heartwarming. To have the boy become like the Fish to learn a lesson was ingenious”—Liam Wilkinson, former editor of “ Prune Juice“ My son who has curly hair wanted me to read him this story 4 consecutive nights at bedtime —“Carrie Walker, parent of 7 year old. ““ I’m a vegan and love your story. I’m sure it would resonate with the 7 million vegan and vegetarians in the USA.”   — Lee Hazelton"

movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,"People talk about poor Rapunzel being locked up in a tower for 18 years. Dudes, have you any idea how hard Quasimodo has it?"
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,"True. In his case it was 20 years, and the outside world actually rejected him."
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0, @Sybil Malkuth  While everyone adored Rapunzel the minute they saw her.
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,EXACTLY!!!!!!!
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,He had it twenty didn't he?
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,"At least Quasimodo was locked in a really big Cathedral whereas Rapunzel was locked in a tower top room barely bigger than a small apartment.Yet Quasimodo had it worst cause whenever he would go out he'd be treated like a monster whereas Rapunzel will be treated with respect just for being pretty, geez even a horse she'd just met obeys her will."
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,The Hunchback of Notre Dame is higher up on the list than Tangled.
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,Andrea Smeelie yep
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,"Colleen Lang yep! It’s basically the same movie, just toned down on the mature themes."
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,"Oliver F. While Quasi did have a little bit more room, the most he could do is ring bells and carve wooden figures. Rapunzel could paint the wall and freakin bake pies. Though a little more space would be nice."
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,"In Rapunzel's case, at least her 'mother' Gothel had some kind of care for her (as revealed by the voice actress) while Frollo had nothing but hatred for Quasimodo!"
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,Side effects of coronavirus include a sudden obsession with Tangled.

movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,Exactly how does one practice social distancing? I don't really understand

movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,"Raghu Seetharaman I have been doing that as well mainly with some of the old school animated Disney movies like Aladdin, the little mermaid, and Lion king. I have also been watching Star Wars the Clone wars, the Timon and Pumba show, and the emperor’s new school although I wish the Aladdin series gets added to Disney plus along with the Rudyard Kiplings Jungle Book."
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,No Coco?? Héctor spent over 95 years holding out in a figurative quarantine!!  He's a legend!!

movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,Disney movies and MsMojo might just make this lock down a lot more tolerable! 
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,@Trina Q Don’t forget Instagram and online friends! 
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,"If you like Tangled the movie, I would definitely recommend watching Tangled: The Series! It's great for the kids to get to watch some more of Rapunzel's adventures, and for adults to see how living with Mother Gothel legitimately traumatized her, and how she's coping. It's a really great show!"
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,"It's a GREAT show, and this is an adult speaking. 31 years old."
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,"I tried watching, but after a few episodes it was too... Childish? Idk but I would like to see some of the spoiled scenes"
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,I love this show!
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0, @HUNKragor  it's very cool after season 2
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0," @HUNKragor  you have to wait till the end of the first season. Trust me, it gets darker and darker, and more for an adult public."
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,It just ended.
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0, @FlashGirl06 MSP  I don't remember that episode... Of which season?
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0," @FlashGirl06 MSP  oh, yes, now I remember!"
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,2010: A kingdom of Corona2020: ....Thank youuu  Ms Mojo for these suggestions!!! 
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,Literally the first thing I did in quarantine was make my mom watch Tangled with me. I said we have to watch it because it’s “corona time” and the irony is just too good to not watch it 
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,Tony Jay playing a complicated villain was so perfect and scary at the same time. Frollo was a fleshed out 3 dimensional character and Jay brought it to life so beautifully. Frollo was definitely a tragic figure.
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,"I just rewatched Wall E and i did not expect myself to cry so much throughout the movie, the most heart-melting and warming movie i have ever seen."
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,I feel like Finding Nemo is a good one for that uncertain transition period we’re going to go through when we first start going out on public again.
movies for kids recommend,G-D_dGnkul0,"I like the list but with a couple of exceptions.  WALL-E should’ve been in the top two. I mean come on he was stranded on an entire planet by himself for 700 years! He is the king of self Quarantine!  Also, where is Aladdin? Stay with me here. Jasmine was kept in home isolation, being socially distant from the entire city the way we all are.  Also the key song in that movie was A Whole New World which we are most certainly going to have when this is all over!"

movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Toy Story 3 will always be the most emotional ending I’ll ever see on a movie. It was amazing.
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Yea I grew up watching those movies
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Pedro Sosa u said it but pixar shouldve made it the last movie. toy story 4 was good but it was unnecessary. toy story 3 was the perfect finale & they shouldve ended it after that. toy story toons & tv specials were fine but they shouldnt have made a fourth movie
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg, @popsingerstar  I agree completely.
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Loki Odinson i remember when i first heard it was confirmed i was more upset than excited but i was only excited a little bit
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,When they were all about to burn in hell & the claw of God rescued them.  Very emotional.
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Pedro Sosa I’m a huge pixar fan but Toy Story 3 is overrated. It’s not as fun or rewatchable as the first two. The movie gets boring after dozens of rewatches. Though the ending is the perfect way to cap off the series... well it was. Now it doesn’t even have that going for it.
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"watch the movie that was #8 on the list (It's such a beautiful day), it's quite possibly the most emotional movie I've ever seen :/"
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,popsingerstar I agree with you 100%
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg," @B for Thigh  The only thing TS3 has going for it it's the ending that is completely unrelated to the rest of the movie, it's like everyone forgets how boring the prison break shit was.TS2 as a movie was overall the best ending to the series."
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg, @Pedro Sosa  you still have a lot to watch then. It was good no doubt. But not near  enough to the most emotional endings. For instance watch Grave of the Fireflies

It has the perfect mix of everything: emotion, action, and comedy, the key aspects of a perfect superhero movie.

movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Check out Beastars.
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,I'm honestly surprised it didn't make the list. I had it just under Frozen myself. It was a fun social commentary but it didn't feel like it was trying to push the narrative. But o well. Different strokes for different folks

movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Jacob Bidelman Fr thought it was gonna suck now it’s one of my favorite movies of all time and one of the best animated movies ever
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,i rewatched the day after i'd seen it for the first time
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,and guess what frozen is on the list
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Totally agree. Zootopia should have been on the list and not just in the honorable mentions.
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,I'm glad that one of the How To Train Your Dragon movies is on this list. It deserves to be here. I definitely think the second one is the strongest and the one to be here
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Well...... I wished it to have the 1st place but a spot at the top 5 is also great . It will always be no. 1 for me .
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,But she chose the far weakest one. the 7.5/10. Why not choose a 9/10 or 10/10 instead! Also how tf is Frozen in any world better that httyd?
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg, @Remas Anwar  same
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,I thought the second one was the weakest in my opinion. Not that it's a bad movie it's great in fact but compared to 3 and 1 it's not as good.
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg, @Swifto  Everyone have diffrent opinions but i acutally think that 2 is better than 1 and 3
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg, @Lucas Ankar  I still disagree with that take strongly still but it’s still just a opinion at the end of the day hence the reason I put “I thought…”
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg, @Swifto  Saying the second one is the weakest doesn't really say much because all the 3 movies are great
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,*Sony makes The Emoji MovieEveryone: “THIS SUCKS!!! NO ONE WILL EVER LIKE YOU!!!”*Sony makes Spider-Man: Into the Spider-VerseEveryone: “All is forgiven.”
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Big facts
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Facts 
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"NedandTheNeedlefishVEVO I was surprised when Hair Love won Best Animated Short cause most of the time, the Pixar shorts tend to win those, but Sony got another winner under their belt. If they continue on the same path with stuff like Spider-verse and Hair Love, they will definitely be up there."
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"Yeah, Venom exists too."
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg, @NedandTheNeedlefishVEVO  Yeah
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg," @NedandTheNeedlefishVEVO  Eh, it was like one of the better early 2000's Marvel movies. It didn't need to be Spiderverse-great, it just needed to be fun, and it was."
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg," @Lauren210  actually, Pixar only wins Best Animated Short when it doesn't win Best Animated Feature. Coco won, but Lou lost to Dear Basketball."
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"Phil Lord, Christopher Miller and Peter Ramsey saved Sony Animations  reputation"
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Inside out really hit me in the heart. Loved that movie. Seems like a normal kids movie at first but what a deep message about life is carries
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Yeah
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"That sometimes being sad can actually help you be happy, and your family helps you out always through sad times to make it get better"
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Absolutely. Shoulda been higher
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,I watched the entire how to train your Dragon trilogy yesterday and the last one really brought tears to my eyes . Those 3 movies are simply phenomenal 
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"I have not watch the part 2 of How to train your dragon, but I had watched the part 1. I would rate that movie 8/10, it's story is not that very complex."
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Watch the defenders of berk and the race to the edge if u want more story of httyd.
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,I hope there Will be more HTTYD MOVIES
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Same here
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"HTTYD is a great franchise, but kfp will always be my favorite, I even got for christmas 2 hoodies Kung Fu Panda"
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Same.
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"Wow man i finished the trilogy yesterday also...Mannn,"
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg, @Niloy Barai  what about Kung fu panda ?
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Incredible series
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"a masterpiece ♡ i actually watched it because ive read several books with different versions, i love every single version of httyd"
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Klaus is criminally underrated
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,True
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,I loved the movie it is  percent in my top 5 favorite Christmas movies
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,The first half is really boring though
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,JAMES BACKSTER IS AWSOME AS HELL
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"I disagree, I was honestly quite mad when I saw this movie on here, I did not enjoy it in the slightest, and the first half of the movie was so unbelievably boring it’s not even funny."
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,I didnt even know that movie existed until my science teacher played it when I was in class last year before the pandemic hit
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Right brothet
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,True
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Ice age is criminally underrated
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,absolutely
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"Into the Spider-verse was an ultimate masterpiece, and the addition of John Mulaney made it even better."
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"7/10 for me , mediocre"
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,It just seemed ok
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg," @Bobby Brian  ikr it wasnt that good, way overhyped"
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg, @Bobby Brian  Then why are you telling to everybody ?
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg, @Bobby Brian I would rate it 8. Comparing it with other superhero movies it's pretty darn good.
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg," @Bobby Brian  Well, the movie shows many things that other superheroes movies don't show, it shows hype music at the starting that lets you know the personality of Miles, it also teaches the lesson that no one obligates you to do the things they expect you to do, you have to be the one interested in doing stuff and creating your own expectations. The movie apart from that emotional basis also has interesting boss fights and persecutions, and also the development of a new superhero, the movie has everything in it, and that is why it Is so good and interesting, because it is not the classic suerhero movie of epic fightscand killing everyone here and there, it marks a before and after in what Miles was and how his mentality changed once he stopped trying to live the expectations others had on him and he started creating his own expectations instead of following others. Also another interesting fact about the movie is how Miles always tries to act like the other superheroes he meets and also act like them but he fails and later he learns that he doesn't have to act like others or live up to the legacy the other Spiderman created but to create his own legacy and to act however he wants to use all his powers. This movie has everything and that is why it is really good."
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,it deserves 10/10 for me
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg, @Abu Taher  only to you. Poor thing

movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,You are god
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Thx..these will be my top movies to watch after exams..meaning after about two months lol
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Have you watched Abominable?
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg, @Binod Tharu  idk about him but I have
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,dragon ball super broly is the best.just loved the animation and fight
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg, @DDP Mastermind  yep
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,I give your list an A+.
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg, @DDP Mastermind  My favorite scene in the movie is definitely Gogeta VS. Broly.
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Who else loves the sloth scene in Zootopia? 
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"Haha, he is super slow. I laughed when he laughed so slow lol."
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,That scene lasted 3 who minutes.
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,I watched Zootopia three times yesterday and am still waiting for Zootopia two but yeah the sloth scene is pretty great
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Flash? Yep! I love him!!
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Especially the last scene
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,I loved Judy Hopps so very much. 
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Flash...hahaha  
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,A Silent Voice is not even an honourable mention. That movie broke me 
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"That is my favorite movie of all time. I watched it for the first time 8 months ago, and fell instantly in love with it. I then got the DVD four days later. Since then, I have watched it 25 more times. A Silent Voice became my favorite movie of all time, and I think without question one of the best movies ever made. It is a very beautiful film, and I think everyone should experience this masterpiece once in their lifetime. I'm going to love and cherish it for as long as I live."
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"And yet Frozen 1 made the list instead!!!!!Take about taking Haterade (which could probably be the Frigid Fire version of Gatorade, except it is a killably poisonous drug)’"
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"Yes, neither was Wolf Children"
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg, @Joey Makes Music  Coco is in the room but Toy Story 3 and frozen yup they need to slap someone.
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Same. I LOVED that movie.
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg, @Kieran Stark  i seriously hate frozen i believe zootopia is much better. Its literally about racism.
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"Peachy_ Aries Yay! Someone who explains why Zootopia deserves more high praise than Frozen (which, tbh, I did anticipate in 2014, if it weren’t for the carbon monoxide poisoning I died from)."
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,my friends claim to never cry and they were bawling their eyes out after i showed them that
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg," @Joexx on neptune  no, only frozen, the other two was great"
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,I watched it yesterday it was incredible
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"""The Adventures of Tintin : The secret of the Unicorn"" deserved to be in this list too....I mean it wasn't even in the honorable mention...It's one of the best comic book adaptation of a non-superhero character. Each and every scene of that movie was simply beautiful. Plus the direction, cinematography and specially the beautiful CGI and VFX were hands down the best of all time for any animated movie."
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,YES YES YES EXACTLY OMGG SOMEONE ACTUALLY SAID IT THANK YOU OHMYGODDDDDDDD
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Finally Truth has been spoken !!!!
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Still waiting for its sequels.
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,First animated movie i have ever seen.
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Tintin should’ve been on the list
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Wait there was second adventure of tintin film
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,I agree
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Coco is the best animation I’ve ever watched.
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Its just so good but  spiderverse is unbeatable
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Pls watch your name
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg," @Adventure of a Lifetime  yep a great movie I love it but for me it doesn't deserve """
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"well u aint seen nothing yet bud, Up 2009 is way better than that, even Inside Out too"
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg, @xx121  I have buddy. And I love both. But coco is something else
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"Book of life is better. Better story, better animation"
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"Nope Up, Walle, Big hero six and How to train your dragon all gets 9/10 by me"
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"Shrek is the father of alll of the animated movies, the best!"
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Cars 3 is better
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Man you haven't seen rango?
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"Coco, Missing Link, Spider Man: Into the Spider Verse, Klaus, and Kubo were my favorite films of this decade"
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Akirex 5000 missing link is so underrated
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Oh yeah I forgot to say Inside Out and Rango
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Coco was amazing
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"I would put Loving Vincent (2017) into the top 10. Every frame of the movie (apart from I think the titles) are oil painted in the style of the post-impressionism style that Van Vovh pioneered. I think that most of the artists were volunteers, but it was well worth the final result. The movie is pure, living art, at the finest level. The story is irrelevant, the art is what counts."
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"Of all animated films, Wall-e and Up will always be my two favorites."
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,I love those movies so much
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"These are from 2008 and 2009 , so they belong to another decade"
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"Coraline, Toy Story 3, and How to Train Your Dragon 2 are my personal faves "
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Miguel Rivas good for you
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Both were made last decade if you were wondering why they were not on the list
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"Great movies, but not of the last decade."
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Miguel Rivas how to train your dragon 3 was also a masterpiece!
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Up is one of the best movies ever made imo. Same with Coco and Toy Story 3.
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg, @Phemelo Murray  I didn't like three compared to the first 2. It just kinda had the soul taken out of it. :/
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"Phemelo Murray all three of them were to be honest, and they get better with every release. Sad that HTTYD 3 is the last one."
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"Zootopia, Tangled, Toy Story 3 and 4, Inside Out, and Frozen "
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"The HTTYD Trilogy is probably my ALL TIME favorite in animation movies  Story, characters, animation, graphics... everything is perfect in it! And without an annoying song that get stuck in your head after watching it (except for the wonderful soundtracks by John Powell)I'm still sad that the third movie didn't get an Oscar. It would have been such a beautiful way to close the trilogy ~"
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"As much as I love How to train your dragon 2, truly, I adore that movie, I personally think the first movie was the best. Both in terms of the story telling, the visuals, the score??? How to train your dragon 2 improves on many things, but the original’s heartwarming tale, just a boy and a dragon, is simply magical. No other way I can describe it, truly it’s an enchanting story."
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Que hemos hecho para merecer estas hermosas animaciones.  Espero que puedas crecer mas como animador y que alguien reconozca tu trabajo.  Porque es increible!! 
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"As an aspiring animator, this was a pretty decent list"
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Song of the Sea deserves so much. That movie is amazing and I wish it would get more recognition. Such a good film.
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,I’m sorry but there’s NO WAY Your Name is 10 spots lower than Frozen.
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Klaus is a beautiful hand drawn movie that i LOVE! So for me its in my top ten!
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Anyone else love THE BOY AND THE BEAST? What a fantastic film this decade!!
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Spider-man: into the spider verse has such beautiful animation it’s such a cool style.
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,My favorites from this list:- Klaus- The Breadwinner- Tangled- Wreck-it Ralph & 2- A Cat in Paris- Your Name- The Tale of Princess Kaguya- Moana- Song of the Sea- The Lego Movie- Inside Out- Kubo and the Two Strings - How to Train Your Dragon 2- Frozen- Coco- Toy Story 3- ParaNorman- Zootopia- I Lost My Body- Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,So far CoCo is the only movie in EXISTENCE!! to make me cry when he was playing the guitar for his grandma I literally started to cry and my family was shocked at that cause they never cried at that part
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,“Your Name” is top 5 definitely.
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"COCO, the best animation film of the last 20 years! Simply breathtaking visuals and classy storytelling. Pixar jumped to a whole new level with this.... And it will be some time before that benchmark is broken."
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"A lot of REALLY GOOD PICKS ON THIS LIST! I would changed the order a bit myself (Your Name is easily my favorite film of the past decade actually), and I would’ve included Big Fish & Begonia as well as Weathering With You, but to each their own.I’m also REALLY glad you included Kubo and the Two Strings, because I feel it’s SO underrated!!"
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,Inside Out is one of my favorite Pixar films! It makes me think of my own core memories and try to figure out what my dominant emotion is. Any movie that makes you think like that is a classic!
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"Love the list. Totally agree with the top 2 choices, although I personally like Toy Story 3 a bit more."
movies for kids recommend,SRww7Uao9fg,"This list should've had the silent voice.Its animation,music and story were so touching ,and it's message was so good. Watchmojo, don't be Oscars now."

movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,"Mhh for me still not better than the first one. I want to start off by saying no movie is perfect, so the reason I put 1 above 2 is cause I can’t find as many flaws"
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,Robert deNiro deserves lifetime  achievement award for movie's.
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,"Road to Perdition and John Gotti (1996) should be mentioned, they are really underrated in my opinion"
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,Agree!!
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,Bronx tale was always one of my faves. Irishman was excellent too I just watched it last night. 3 and a half hours of excellence.
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,"Gotti 1996 with Assante ,not Travolt,is superb and should be in this list"
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,For sure
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,Agreed
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,"Agreed (Travolta one is awful, but had to watch just because)"
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10, @bmac78  I think it was pretty good. I like them both.
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,I agree is excellent. Along with Goodfellas and Donnie Basco is the most accurate mafia movie.
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,Is the Travolta one not worth watching?
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10, @Howard Ronamald  Nope
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,Definitely
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,Ahmygosh thank you 🙏 for that Asante not travolta
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,"I'm going to buy the Travolta one to watch, despite what everyone says. He is a really great actor. Not sure how well he did as Gotti, but its gotta be good."
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,"American Gangster, (The film stars Denzel Washington),  &  Public Enemy (Johnny Depp)must have been in this list."
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,My favourites are :-The untouchables (1987)Godfather (1972)Scarface (1983)Gangs of Wasseypur (2012)Vastaav (1999)The Irishman (2019)The Departed (2006)Nayakan (1987)Donnie brasco (1997)
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,Ur indian innit
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10, @Haseeb Skillz  you are right i am indian i missed Parinda 1989
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,Once upon a time in America should be in there along with Carlito`s way
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,Definitely! 😉
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,AGREED!! Both are in my Top 5
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,I agree if it was top ten gangster movies but they’re not mafia movies
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,​ @afr malatesta Yep Once upon a Time in America Definitely is a Masterpiece.
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10, @Ksav  those are definitely mafia movies they just aren't Italian based mafia movies
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10, @LC  Its about the Jewish mob
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,Deadass
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,Mafia Carlitos way wasn’t mafia
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,857noel so should Scarface
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,"Exactly, I am agree with you."
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,My List:1-The Godfather Part I2-Goodfelass3-The Godfather Part II4-Once upon a Time in America5-Casino6-American Gangster7-The Departed8-Scarface9-Donnie Brasco10-The Untouchables
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,Pesci needed to be #1 for playing Russell Buffalino.  He killed that roll
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,"thanks to you i just watched ""a bronx tale"" and it was an amazing move, loved every second of it, thank you"
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,Cant believe you left out1996’s  “Gotti” starring Armand Assante as John Gotti.Awesome portrayal.3rd on my list.
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,Once upon a time in America should NOT be in the honorable mention category..it is the most underrated gangster movie of all time
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,"Donnie Brasco is so underrated, luckily sometimes not forgotten to add to top10 lists like this. Al Pacino is one of the greatest actors of all time, no matter he is playing in a mafia movie or not like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGNAYWofLc8Scarface is missing, although a true gold!"
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,"You missed on two GEMS , American Gangster and Scarface."
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,You watch deNero in these films and then watch him in The Intern. What an actor!
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,"I think Goodfellas should be #1 it doesn't glorify ""the life"" Henry's miserable and terrified half if not most the time and also it doesn't end on a low note, (Godfather 3) and it's not just a mafia movie it starts as a sort of coming of age movie then transitions into a gangster story and then near the end it became a drug movie."
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,Once Upon a Time in America (The original European version) is a masterpiece . Directed by Sergio Leone with cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli and Film score by Ennio Morricone. Starring Robert De Niro and James Woods.  In this list it gets an honourable mention but in my opinion its a top three mobster movie.
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,Godfather definitely number 1!
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,Goodfellas is personally my favorite movie of all time followed by tombstone but I do think godfather deserves #1
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,"A bronx tale is my top 5, I love it. Don't know why but I do. Want my kids to see it but not yet. To young and angry lol"
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,"Scarface is a gangster movie, not mafia wtf."
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,For me the best of all time are:1) Once Upon a Time in America (1984)2) The Godfather/Godfather pt. II (1972)3) Goodfellas (1990)4) Scarface (1983)5) Casinò (1995)6) Sonatine (1993)7) Pulp Fiction (1994)8) Carlito's Way (1993)9) Gomorra (2008)10) American Gangster (2007)
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,Kevin Costner is like an acting novice compared to the talent of Robert DeNiro
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,"Great video! 👍 Personally I think ""The Departed"" is overrated, but the others are definetely awesome. By the way, recently a book about Mafia films came out. Movies like ""Goodfellas"", ""Casino"" ore ""Donnie Brasco"" are reviewed, and the real events in which they are based are also analyzed. It´s very interesting not only for gangster movie lovers but also for people who like to read about real Mafia history and facts. The name of the book is ""Mafia films – a guide"" and you can find it on Amazon."
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,How can you forget Al Pachino's Scarface....Without it this list is incomplete..
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,Casino is better than Departed And I’m just happy Donnie Branco made the list... so underrated
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,One thing is for the sure De Niro is everywhere... Awesome man
movies about mafia recommend,mghDRQVrX10,I just recently watched the godfather trilogy and the first one was awesome second was cool but not what I expected  and third didn't care for at all really wish I got to see waaaayyyyyy more of Robert dinero as vito so much more like I wish the entire last movie was more about young Vito instead of the ending of the old ways or organized crime
movies about mafia recommend,nwnYc7fbjOI,"So much respect for The Irishman being number one, so many people didn’t understand the film, but you explained it, also ranked it brilliantly."
movies about mafia recommend,nwnYc7fbjOI,Bro The Irishman easily became one of my favorite movies

movies about mafia recommend,p2Gzvt0NzAE,"Similarly to our last video, we understand that some viewers might have a different “definition” of what is considered a gangster film, however for our video, films such as ‘True Romance’, ‘Reservoir Dogs’, ‘Heat’ and ‘The Usual Suspects’ haven’t been included as we don’t really consider those to be gangster films in the same light as the ones in our list."
movies about mafia recommend,p2Gzvt0NzAE,"Millers crossing is awesome.The departed is one of the best gangster films ever. Goodfellas definitely the number one of all time.Eastern Promises is very underrated, as is snatch and lock stock which is better than snatch."
movies about mafia recommend,p2Gzvt0NzAE,lock stock is amazing
movies about mafia recommend,p2Gzvt0NzAE,Great selections.  I agree with Goodfellas at number one - that films is amazing!
movies about mafia recommend,p2Gzvt0NzAE,"Scarface, Godfather, same level"
movies about mafia recommend,p2Gzvt0NzAE, @archivaldo portugal  godfather should not be labelled as a gangster movie
movies about mafia recommend,p2Gzvt0NzAE, @V C  its the greatest gangster film and best film of all time

movies about mafia recommend,p2Gzvt0NzAE,"Nice list.However,two films from that great year of 1990 should of at least got honourable mentions,if not included in the top ten - State Of Grace,and King Of New York.Especially S.O.G.One of Oldman's best performances."
movies about mafia recommend,p2Gzvt0NzAE,Donnie Brasco was such a nice movie
movies about mafia recommend,p2Gzvt0NzAE,"Sure, the Departed which is entirely copied from Infernal Affairs makes the list, and Infernal Affairs which is the original (and even slightly better as a movie per se) is just in the honorable mentions..."
movies about mafia recommend,p2Gzvt0NzAE,This movie is older(70's) but i suggest the warriors you probably watched it already since rockstar made a game about it but it's a good movie it wouldn't hurt to rewatch it
movies about mafia recommend,p2Gzvt0NzAE,cant argue with this list. great choices.
movies about mafia recommend,p2Gzvt0NzAE,The departed was brilliant

movies about mafia recommend,p2Gzvt0NzAE,The Godfather... hello!
movies about mafia recommend,OfQo98ZrhTE,The God father is definitely one of my favorites! Thank you for this
movies about mafia recommend,OfQo98ZrhTE,Keep the mob movie reviews coming cause I have mob movies from when I was a kid that I'm still looking for
movies about mafia recommend,OfQo98ZrhTE,"Thanks for this video. Now I have more mob movies to watch. A couple of things: 1. The 'e' is silent in Pistone.. I've heard Joseph pronounce his last name.2. In Pulp Fiction, the guys did not steal Marcellus Wallace's briefcase. They'd previously made a deal with Marcellus, but they double-crossed him."
movies about mafia recommend,OfQo98ZrhTE,Love those 70s gangster films. The Valachi Papers was solid. Not good enough for this list but good enough for top 30. Same with Dillinger.
movies about mafia recommend,OfQo98ZrhTE,"The godfather and goodfellas, masterpieces that are both in the top 10 movies of all time."
movies about mafia recommend,OfQo98ZrhTE,Hello again Facts Verse  I honestly think that Goodfellas should have been higher up on the list. Besides The Godfather movies Goodfellas should be right after that. Thank you for another great video and I hope you and your subscribers have a wonderful day 
movies about mafia recommend,OfQo98ZrhTE,Scarface was the ultimate gangster movie. A meteoric rise and fall. Tony’s gang knew they only had limited time and made the best of it. The Godfather was more about a family.
movies about mafia recommend,OfQo98ZrhTE,I have seen Goodfellas and as well as all three of the Godfather movies. Loved them all.
movies about mafia recommend,OfQo98ZrhTE,There was a production made that melded Godfather I and Godfather II together but I don't know if it was considered a stand alone movie
movies about mafia recommend,OfQo98ZrhTE,Goodfellas is great because it was based on actual events.
movies about mafia recommend,OfQo98ZrhTE,There are a few on this list that I wouldn’t consider mob movies
movies about mafia recommend,OfQo98ZrhTE,Man I seen all these movies through the years great count down

movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,Aman Meshram What on earth is The Greace (#16)? 😂😂
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA, @LucienSabre  I know 😅I too myself was bit baffled for a moment.
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,Aman Meshram Then why did you leave the mistake (instead of correcting it)? 😄
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,I actually agree with her list for the 3 time I've been following her for 3 years now I 100% agree with this
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA, @LucienSabre  Done.
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,Aman Meshram Nope. 😜
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA, @LucienSabre  now?
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,Aman Meshram Perfect. 👍👍👍
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,We salute you❤️
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,Thanks
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,"Mean Girls is an extremely memorable and enjoyable teen movie, but The Breakfast Club perfectly encapsulates the teenage experience which is what a teen movie should do, in my opinion. Also, I wish Dead Poets Society was here, but I can just cry in silence about that"
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,The Breakfast Club has aged now. Mean Girls still feels fresh and modern.
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA, @julia jones  How so.
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,10 Things I Hate About You is the best teen movie!!!!
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,Couldn’t agree more!!
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,For a moment I thought you were insulting her lol.
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,No ❤️
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,Yessss
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,It wasn't That good
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,Agreed!
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,Yes!!!😃😍
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,U damm right
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,Yes and The perks of being a wallflower.
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,"one of the best I’m still looking for some more teen romance movies. but so far, agreed :)"
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,The perks of being a wallflower changed me the way the fault in our stars changed me. Beautiful movie.
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,I absolutely and will always adore The breakfast club and/or The craft. Im may be a 2000s baby but 80s-90s teen flicks will always have a place in my heart
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,"I wish Juno was more than an honorable mention, even though not every teenager can relate to it ever since I watched it for the first time I've always loved it 😭 it's one of my all time comfort movies weirdly enough"
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,"I appreciated the casting for 8th Grade, because even as a high schooler, it feels nice to have teens around my age accurately portrayed with pimples, blemishes, etc."
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,"I'd have included Juno and Bring It On somewhere in the top 10. Also a bit surprised at no Princess Diaries or American Pie, which still kind of holds up despite being a gross-out movie.A personal favourite of mine is Angus, purely for how relatable it was for me as both an overweight teen and a punk/alt rock fan. The soundtrack is brilliant."
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,After screaming “OH MY GOD THIS IS SO GOOD IT SHOULD’VE BEEN NUMBER ONE” at every movie in this list I realised I might be addicted to teen movies
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,"I would add ""She's All That"" and ""Cruel Intentions"" in this list."
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,"""The Perks of being a Wallflower"" should've been #1 and ""The Duff"" should've at least been an honorable mention!"
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,I love the breakfast club as much as anyone but I don’t understand how it is dubbed the best teen movie ever by everyone
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,"I did not like it. Its not very spontaneous and it does not have a ""plot"" to back it up."
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,"I've always thought it was overrated.  And it annoyed me that after all the heartfelt revelations, everyone pairs off and leaves the nerd to write the essay."
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,It represents high in more realistic then any other movie out there. You may not like but its the real reality on how teens get treated and feel about high-school
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA, @Brajesh Singh  it doesn't need a plot it's about students in a Saturday detention. And resolutions is that people from different cliques can become friends regardless on who's your current friends are
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA, @David Rich  he dosent stay to write the essay and he willingly wrote it for them. How is it hard to see that they all become friends at the end. And the movie is about a regular high-school life and the struggle they face before setting off to college
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA, @A K  it's an iconic movie and the best representation of teenage and high-school.
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA, @ashbala khan  degeneracy?
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,It isn’t there are better movies lmao
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,I mean u have to look at the context. It was an 80's teen movie taking high school n teen struggle srsly. It was rly profound.
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,I absolutely LOVE both ‘Mean Girls’ and ‘The Breakfast Club’!!!
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,582: I also enjoy The Breakfast Club. Those actors did such a good job as their characters. I love the song and quotes.
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,"I’m pleasantly shocked to see Love, Simon so high....It deserves so much more praise and recognition that what it did though...I really wish it was released when I was growing up"
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,"Mean Girls seriously should’ve waited to come out in 2007, because Misery Business By Paramore would be even more legendary than it already is if it was that movie’s main soundtrack song, only thing about that is that Lindsay lost her damn mind around that time, but if that wasn’t the case it would’ve been perfect"
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,"In 2007: Lindsay Lohan was drugged out, Rachel McAdams was almost 30. There's no way Mean Girls would be what it is without the 2 best actresses in it. Also, Mean Girls came out at the perfect time, before social media and cell phones were everywhere. Mean Girls had one cheap looking flip phone (with a pink case so it doesn't feel as dated as it should). If the movie came out 3 years later, everyone would have those cheap flip phones and the movie would be wayyyy outdated. Look at John Tucker Must Die."
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,For so long I had no idea just how colossal of a hit Mean Girls became.
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,"Literally every teenager ever (Ladybird). It's crazy but so intense, feeling misunderstood and invincible."
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,RIP Heath Ledger 🙏♥️
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,I absolutely LOVE both ‘Mean Girls’ and ‘The Breakfast Club’!!!
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,"20. The Faults In Our Stars17. Easy A9. To All The Boys I'd Loved Before8. 10 Things I Hate About You7. Love, Simon4. CluelessMY FAVS:Legally BlondePretty In PinkFlippedLove, Rosie"
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,I was so glad to finally see The Breakfast Club. That’s my favorite movie of all time. I have watched a few of the other ones before but they just didn’t compare to TBC. The only thing I didn’t like was the fact that it wasn’t #1. Thank you anyway for a good video 👍
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,"There are so many great teen movies. It would be nice to see  the top 10 movies of every decade. The 70’s, 80’s, 90’s etc."
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,"The common factor in all of these films is that they portray the socialization of developing teens, and how they interact with other teens, and their parents and teachers.  The Diary Of Anne Frank is very different.  The normal process of growing up is altered by the fact that Anne and her family are in hiding, and have very little contact with other people.  This lack of connection seems to have been very frustrating, from what I remember of reading the book."
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,Grease and Mean Girls are classics! I still like A Cinderella Story. I grew up in a time where everyone loved anything Hilary Duff was in
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,581: Ferris Bueller Day’s Off is another fav! So irresistible and fun to watch! That actor is golden. I can see the movie as a musical
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,"How could you forget ""Permanent Record?""  This vastly underrated 80's film starred a pre-Bill And Ted Keanu Reeves as a high school student dealing with the suicide of his best friend, and finding support from the other students.  Also, ""Say Anything,"" which was a such a good teenage love story that even my late mom liked it."
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,"I was having such a genuine blast until “Clueless” was topped by #’s 2 & 3, which I get are now beloved classics, but imo are both insanely overrated. But then the honorable mentions came & made it fun again! No, not the disrespecting of “Bring It On”; but the surprising inclusion of “Me, Earl & the Dying Girl”!!!"
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,Please make an A-Z for the Best and Worst teen movies of all time!
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,My list:1. Clueless2. Breakfast club3. 10 things I hate about you4. Bring it on5. Easy A7. The edge of seventeen8. Road trip 9. Dazed and confused
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,The fact that the lovers in the fault in our stars are siblings in Divergent...:’D
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,"Good list, and I love To All The Boys (as an example, there are many new movies on this list), but if we're talking about movies that define generations, maybe we should be more than ~4 years removed from the movie."
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,So freaking hilarious love this list ❤
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,The Edge of Seventeen is the best 🤘♥️
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,"The honorable mentions deserve to be on the list and I think we can all easily take away Cinderella story, she's the man, etc to make room."
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,30 secs into the vid and I already knew Mean Girls is #1. 😌✨
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,"Great list id like to say i also like Dope, Spiderman Homecoming,High School Musical and Scott Pilgrim vs the world"
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,Who else loves ‘Back to the future’???😅
movies for teenager recommend,wFw3Y9kExAA,"im sorry but breakfast club is THE teen movie, and all other movies just follow it, so it should be number one!!"

movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,"Okay first of all Bucky is a victim, Erik is a victim, and Loki is a victim"
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,exactly !! I personally wouldn't call them villains
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,Every villian has a tragic back story (well almost all) but they still do some fucked up shit and they play the villians in their respective movies.
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,That's it play the victim card lol ...excuses excuses
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,bucky is the only one who's truly victim here. erik and loki are just villains.
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4," @Harley Quinn  bucky is not a villain, he's antihero. and again, loki and erik are true villains, yes.not *victims, you should check what you wrote."
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,You're wrong on 2 of those. Loki and Erik are definitely villains. Winter Soldier is debatable
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,"Erik and Loki were definitly villains.Cool motive still a murder, as we say"
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,THANK YOU! Finally someone is actually intelligent in this world other than me.

movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,"I'm the same way. Reason? Most of them are very sauve and debonair. They're slick, and most of the time with women they're manipulating, but so polite. Thats the mark of a good villain in most movies anymore... They make you love them."
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,To all the girls: Get yourself a man that looks at you the same Loki looks at the tesseract.

movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,The way I like to see it is that the winter soldier is a villain (yes also a victim but when he’s brainwashed he’s kinda evil) but Bucky is a hero
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,"But besides that, he should be number one"

movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,In the winter soldier he is ... 😔
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,Can't argue with that logic
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,Agreed
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4," @Kero Kero  ""Not a villian"" he murdered people"
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4, @Alicia Simmons  yep but idk he s kinda cute i mean.. he would never have done such things if he wasn t brainwashed.. poor him
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,THANK YOU!
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,As winter soldier he is.
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,"oh Bucky, he isn't really bad he's just slightly brainwashed to be an assassin. I forgive him."
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,“Sex appeal an aging Hugh Jackman couldn’t offer-“ EXCUSE ME?!
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,"""Who do you think is the sexiest villian?""Me :LOKI III III II II I I II I I I I I I II I"
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,I fall in love with Loki. I was he is real. Loki is not evil. People don't understand. He is just born that way cause he's actually adopted by Odin( Thor's Dad) . He also helps Thor fight in the ending of Thor The Dark World and he will again in Thor Ragnarok in 2017. Can't wait for the movie!
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,"I love number 7, and I totally think that he should have been MUCH higher up on the list (like number 1). I like that not only was Loki mentioned, you put him as number 2 (I don't if I agree that Thor is 'arguably hotter' because there's something about Loki, so I'd put them on equal footing in terms of hotness)."
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,The comments...90% WHY ISN'T LOKI FIRST?9% BUCKY ISN'T A VILLAIN1% The restI love the Marvel fandom
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,was there any other way really?
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,I have mixed feelings about marvel
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,I have strong aggressions bc of the two comments above me
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,"If Bucky is on 7th, I need a glass of water before I  see the rest of the video.And he's not a villain. He's a victim."
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,HELL YEAAAAHHH GRRRWAAAAA
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,I KNOW RIGHT
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,"Oh my god; I say the ""not a villain, but a victim"" about sooo many characters. THANK YOU."
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,"Everyone missed the fact that she said Hugh Jackman played old Magneto, excuse me?! That is Sir Ian Mckellen"
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,I think she was saying wolverine was getting to old to be sexy to the younger viewers lol 😄
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,"Loki for me is the sexiest villain ever, gorgeous man Tom Hiddleston is <3"
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,"Ikr, hehehe"
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,yus
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,yes! he should be #1
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,omg i know right he should be on a first place😍
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,"+Kayla Rose There should be a list of all the sexy of Loki.  #1 would be his voice, imho."
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,"+Kayla Rose yeah, definitely :) When she said ""arguably hotter older brother"" i was like "" bitch, what? go get you eye sight checked!"""
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,"+Samantha Green Thor is hunkier than Loki, and by that I mean more muscular. But I've never been into muscles. Loki is #1 on my list as well- he's hotter by my standards. His hair, his eyes, his smirk! I cannot get enough Loki."
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,Loki IS number one in my opinion. Love Loki 😊
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,agreeeee
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,yup
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,So glad Cillian was finally on a list but he should have been number one!!
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,"Yyyyeeeeeeeeeeeeah, Loki should have been number one."
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,"Calm down, people! She said ""Arguably hotter brother"". There are probably people out there, who think that Chris is hotter than Tom. That's normal! That's called ""different opinions"". Cool, right?"
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,Cillian Murphy's eyes are gift from the gods!
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,Bucky is NOT a villain he is a victim!  Loki is Not a villain he is a victim! Chris Hemsworth is not hotter than Tom Hiddleston!
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,"Even though Bucky isn‘t a villain, the reason he is so sexy is also the awesome performance of Seb! He only has a few lines but steals everyone the show!"
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,"Excuse me, but why is Bucky 7TH? He should have been second and Loki should have been first."
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,Thor hotter than Loki???!?!? Hands her glasses
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,PLEASE DO A TV VERSION!! And have it include Peter Pan- Once Upon A Time Void Stiles- Teen WolfKlaus Mikaelson- The Vampire Diaries Damon Salvatore- TVD (he was a villain at one point!)
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,Technically... Bucky isn't a villain. He is mind controlled. Duh...
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,Bucky is not a villain but since he's on this list he should have been 1
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,They should include Darth Vader before he started wearing the suit. He is so dark but at the same time he looks so hoot!
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,"It's incredible, I wanted to make a comment about Loki, but 80% of the comments mention him. The fandom is so powerful, I'm proud of you."
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,why are psychos always so hot
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,"Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth is devilishly sexy. Horrible fascist but still mesmerizing. My fav villain. Matthew Goode as Charles in Stoker is hot as hell. So charming and attractive. Yoo Ji-tae as Woo jin-Lee in Old boy is pretty hot and tempting. I would mention Evan Peters as Tate. He is so charismatic, even if you know it's wrong to love such a bad guy you still do. Just can't help it."
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,I always found billy attractive but at the same time I was terrified of him lol and Loki is the sexiest villian of all time
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,Tom Hiddleston will always be my number 1💯💯💯
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,I definitely agree with Bucky and Loki.  Sebastian Stan is my favorite actor in terms of looks.
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,Tom Hiddleston (Loki) is my all-time crush 😂
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,I would have picked Loki (the avengers) for #1
movies with attractive villains recommend,DrcyPA75Pf4,God I love Jai Courtney 😍😍 And Bucky isn't actually evil
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Draco Malfoy came 8th??!?!!?!? Wait until his father hears about it.
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"Lol, that was slick."
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Usha Dalvi 
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Usha Dalvi WAIT UNTIL MY FATHER HEARS ABOUT THIS!!! DRACO IS THE BEST AND SO IS HIS SON THO NOT AS HOT HE'S STILL SO FUNNY
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Missycrafter  Potter am I not getting your point or are you high?
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,lol
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,OMG I'm dying
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"At least he was #2 when it came to watchmojo's Top Ten Movie Brats. LOL. Seriously, I'm really glad they acknowledges that Tom Marvolo Riddle aka teen Voldemort was swoon-worthy. I'm talking about Christian Coulson in COS. Frank Dillaine in HBP couldn't hold a candle to him! Who else agrees w/me on that one?"
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,I started choking on my water
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"straburyred I agree, Christian will always be Tom Riddle!"
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Usha Dalvi Wait until I hear about it>:'(
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Tom Riddle should have gotten his own part on this list.
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,I KNOW RIGHT OMG
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,I CAME LOOKING FOR HIM
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"Adam Driver is weird, off-center, and quirky. His face is a mass of contradictions and oddities. His voice dripping with testosterone, his height, awkwardness, shyness and overall personality suits him and makes him unconventionally interesting rather than making him strange or not-so flattering bizarre it could have done. Living proof that you can be beautiful without being conventionally attractive."
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Wow. I could not have said it better.
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"he soooooo fucking attractive, i  almost drool when i seee him."
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Exactly.
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Kylo Ren is a cutie
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,I see how some people consider Draco a villain I just think the title is rather unfairly placed upon him
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,I agree. He isn't really a villain. He's a boy who had ni choice
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"MsMojo needs to keep doing the sexiest male villains lists. There's always new ones popping up, and villains are just the best."
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"he's on the first list, this is just the second part"
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"Kiriyama? He was just an honorable mention in the first video, which means he was shy of getting in the top 10. With Watchmojo, that usually means those mentions end up in the part 2 video, but they ignored them this time around, I guess."
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,agreed
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,yasss
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Roses are redViolets are blueI came for the thumbnail So did you
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,biggie sad true
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"Yep, you got me.I mean, look at his smileee"
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Yap
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Best comment
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,True...
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"I like that Draco is on this list, but I'm not 100% sure if he's exactly a villian"
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"David from ""The Guest"" is my favourite because not only is he sexy as hell, he also has unbelievable charm that makes people trust him. He literally acts so polite throughout the entire movie despite killing various people now and then."
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"some of these guys aren't really considered ""hot"" by public standards, so I think it's more of the sex appeal they give off. I wouldn't really think kylo ren is super attractive, but with the bad boy thing going on, it works in his favor."
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Everyone definitely joined the dark side after seeing Kylo Ren shirtless in The Last Jedi.
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Draco's really not that bad... just misunderstood and raised with bias and prejudice
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Elizabeth Giles really wish he gotten a redemption arc
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Weirdly a lot less attractive when you put it like that.
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"Bullies are evil. People who fancy bullies are weak minded, and evil."
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Thank you! Yes.
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"Who else cringed when she said Draco had green eyes , he has grey eyes ..."
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Georgina Hirst Me...Harry Potter is the one who has green eyes. MsMojo was lazy.
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Georgina Hirst Book Draco's eyes are gray. Tom Felton has green eyes. Same as in the books Harry is described as having bright green eyes but Daniel Radcliff has blue eyes.
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"Krista Shafer I think both have blue eyes, only in different hues..."
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"If he had grey eyes he would probably be blind. Grey isn't an eye colour, it MAY have actually been a light blue (like my sibling's eyes which DO look grey but have a tinge of blue), but otherwise, they ain't wrong, you are.Sorry not trying to make it seem like I'm threatening you"
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,I have grey eyes and am not blind. So...yea.
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,It’s more of bluish grey but it’s definitely not green
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo, @Rain WhiteBuffalo  I'm fucking jealous I LOVE gray eyes
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo," @Kyllian Thorn  grey do exist, i have seen people with grey eyes."
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Lady Voldemort no harry has green eyes and draco has blue eyes
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Draco is not a villain but I'm watching this anyway bc I love Draco. Lol.
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Oh he`s a villain alright...he´s not pure evil...obviously not as bad as Voldemort but still a villain...he was on the dark side for a while
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,He was a scared little boy who only copied what his father said to make himself seem intelligent (which obviously backfired).
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Same he's the only reason I watched this
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"Am I the only one girl that finds the Joker SOO attractive??And I'm not saying that because of Jared Leto's version (though you can't deny his sexy appeal), because I liked the Joker before Suicide Squad came out. My favorite version of the Joker is in Arkham videogames, specially Origins.All Hail the Clown Prince Of Crime!!"
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,The dark Knight one did have a certain...something.
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Angie Carrizo same
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,definitely
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Angie Carrizo OMG...i thought i was psychotic..I LOOOVE Joker since the beggining especially the catoon ones...
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"Ryn .o.  right? hahaha, I love Mark Hamill's voice "
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Angie Carrizo I thought that Hoya-Joker was the hottest...I don't think anyone else understands what I'm talking about
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"Caitlyn Hoya was hot <3 U-kwon was really nice too though, but in a different way"
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Angie Carrizo i'm have a crush on Joker(Heath Ledger) for so long
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"Yeah, yeah. My Jerome will never be added."
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Angie Carrizo well I may not be a girl but I do find him strikingly attractive
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,I'm upset that my favorite Villain ever isn't on either of these lists: David Bowie as Jareth the Goblin King in Labrynth
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Mads Mikkelsen as Hannibal Lecter!
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Idk I feel if any Hannibal would make it it would be Gaspard Ulliel from Hannibal Rising.
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"I honestly don't think Mads is ""hot"", I would put Gaspard Ulliel as Hannibel Lecter, he is hot"
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Mads is hotness incorporated.
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"Where is Jason Dean? Also Kylo? Really? I always thought he looked like a coward and wasn't intimidating enough, and that was what took away from his sex appeal. When he took his helmet off I laughed and I wasn't the only one. Also HOW DID DRACO COME IN 8TH?!?!?!?!?!?!?! He is wayyyyyyyyy more attractive than most people on this list."
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,What about Jason Dean from Heathers? He's pretty adorable.
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,I saw Draco and clicked 
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,same
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,same
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,yess
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,IKR
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Same 
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Same
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"Same here, but why is he so low in the list? :/"
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,The Reese walker Adventures same
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,The Reese walker Adventures SAME XD
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Same! I was mad when he wasn't in the  first video lol
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Two of Emma Watson's costars are on this list: Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy and Dan Stevens who will play the Beast opposite her as Belle next year in Beauty and the Beast.
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Of course Tom Felton is on this list.It's like the most obvious thing ever
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,THAT AWKWARD HUG IS MY FAVORITE SCENE
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,My top male villains1) Khan <32) Loki3) Kylo
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,How is J.D. from Heathers not on this list?! OR THE FIRST LIST?! Not even an honorable mention?!?!?!?! He may be a bad boy outcast but he is one sexy villain
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Ugh how can Jeffrey Dean Morgan not be in here.I'm completely captivated by his role as Negan in twd 
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"Before I watch this, if I don't see Draco Malfoy and Kylo Ren, I'm gonna be so sad. EDIT:YES, MY SONS."
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"I didn't even watch the video; I just came here to defend my son Draco Malfoy and say that he's not a villain, he's a smol precious child who needs to be protected ok bye"
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"There is a tendency for fanfic writers to write irredeemable villains as misunderstood anti-villains who just need love, usually because they're just too hot to keep on the dark side. Draco Malfoy is such a popular target of this trope that it's been named Draco in Leather Pants."
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"Kylo is my favorite Villain next to Loki, they’re both such tall drinks of water."
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,I had the biggest crush on Draco Malfoy for the longest time <3
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"Am I the only one who was pissed at Dracos eyes being described as green, when felton has blue eyes and Draco the character has iron grey eyes?"
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Gaspard Uliel as Hannibal was notably absent from this list.
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,I'm only here for Draco
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"I LOVE how they said tall, dark and handsome and Idris Elba is literally all those things!!!"
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Absolute hands down: ANDREW SCOTT as Moriarty in the show Sherlock. He's the embodiment of sexy villian and even won an award for his role.
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"How Ryan Guzman in ""The Boy Next Door "" failed to make either list is beyond my comprehension."
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"Really happy to see Kylo Ren so high in the ranking ! I think this character is really underestimated and deserve more attention. So... i'm happy :)I would also like to see Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor (pretty attractive !) and Gaspard Ulliel as Hannibal (so damn hot !). Maybe in ""Top 10 Sexiest Male villains PT.3""  ;)"
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"I have had a crush on Tom Felton ever since the moment he said ""and Im Malfoy, Draco Malfoy"""
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,Saw Draco Malfoy and instantly watched xD
movies with attractive villains recommend,r9hcpVcV-Zo,"De todos ellos, yo me quedo con Draco Malfoy. Porque no solo es un gran personaje y esta buenísimo en todos los sentidos, sino que es el único chico malo en toda la ficción que es duro y elegante al mismo tiempo..."
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Who do you think is the best movie villain of the century so far?!
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,I'd say Joker of The Dark Knight.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,I think the best villain of the century so far is King Ghidorah
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,I think the best villain of the century is Darth Sidious.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,WatchMojo kylo ren is one the best Star Wars villains ever love you videos 💝 I’m being strong got Disney+ watching avengers endgame to get all caught up on phase 4

movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Sounds legendary
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Vignesh S A good performance but they are laying it on a little thick.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,You’re gonna lose your shit when you find out what production company helped produce it
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Vignesh S Laughs in Joaquin Phoenix

movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Happy birthday heath
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Well it was so good it more or less killed the actor so I think that really says something.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Vignesh S legendary is pushing it a bit. Ledger gave a better performance in B.B.M
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,I think we can say that about both portraits of the Joker on the list.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"Rawr5649 it was so f*cking long by the time it’d finished I’d graduated ,worked and retired  😂"
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Joker is the only badass villain that can make the list twice!
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"even more, i mean jack as joker was great too"
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,But he didn't make it twice
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"I retract my previous statement, I had to watch the video twice. When I watched the 1st time when they said society was #1 I immediately turned the video off."
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,And Joaquin Phoenix the only badass actor that can also make it twice.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Darth Vader
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,No
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,He is in my opinion by far the top villan of all time. He has all the best qualities of a villan can have. No one will ever top Heath Ledgers Joker.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,aang amirul hafidz it was only for the century or we would’ve gotten all 4 jokers
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Says a lot about society
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Miguel Galarza bruh
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"I loved the 2019 Joker, but Heath Ledgers' portrayal of the joker is the best. R.I.P. Heath ❤"
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,No one can replace ledger for me.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU," @DOGandSQUIRRELSLOL 89  same here, Heath was amazing as the joker. ❤"
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"I wish DC Comics make a Joker comic's to look more like, Heath Ledger's Joker. now and days. Cause he made the look and image so different in the film."
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"Heaths joker was the best, he was in such great movie as well😭💔"
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU, @Megalon73  that would be garbage. Joker from the comics design is way better. Also just a better character in general. Heath is a good character. Not a good Joker. Jack Nicolson nailed Joker from the comics.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU," @Mr Mxyzptlk  Hey, Bub! Jack Nicolson. is good, But he did not win an Oscar. Plus I prefer the sequel ""Batman:Return"" more sine I've seen that one way more. Going back to, Heath! He won the Oscar for that role! and Damn right it is still amazing."
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU, @Megalon73  Oscar doesn’t mean more accurate. It was an amazing performance. It just wasn’t Joker. And to me isn’t as good as Joker.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU, @Mr Mxyzptlk  And clearly you’re not a fan of a true phenomenal actor
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU, @Megalon73  I like him. I’m a bigger fan of Nicolson tho. Who’s a better actor IMO.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"Hamill, though…"
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,The fact that Davy Jones didn’t even get an honorable mention…
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Bro I’m just pissed man hes like one of the best
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU, @Dylan Lilley  you’re smokin
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,He is the best villain of all time.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,This is no longer your world Jones 😢
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,I would have liked to see Magneto get atleast an honourable mention
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,That scene in the first x-men where magneto shot the police officers but held  the bullets in the air was pretty badass
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"He should be in the top 5, both Michael Fassbender and Ian McKellen were amazing"
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,And Davey Jones
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"At least in number 2, dude was well performed by two damn great actors, and pretty much carried the X-Men movies"
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"Or Glass, Brightburn, or Mysterio."
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Or take the place of the 2019 joker since heath is the best
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"Magneto as a villain, yes. But he was not used to that level in the movies."
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,They should have replaced Kylo with Magneto.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,He should be in Thanos' place
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"never mind that, Ra's Al Ghul from BB didn't even get a place, one of the best"
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"I think Davy Jones deserves a spot on this list. ""Do ye fear death?""  ""You've no idea."""
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Dont u?
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Heath Ledger‘s Joker is going to be number one. I’m calling it.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,You called it
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"Sniper Ultra Never. Heath Ledgers joker is Legendary, compared to Thanos."
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,I think he is a bit too overrated. The movie is pretty shit.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU," @Joseph Mulipola  6 replies to some triggered kid, you sure that's enough?"
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Joseph Mulipola dude have you seen the dark knight? Heaths performance is the probably the best comic book portrayal ever in film history. I do like marvel more but nothing beats the dark knight
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,He is good but overrated.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU, @Gaming With Ryan  Nah he'd probably just laugh. But who knows.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Wow a lot of drama happening here 0_0
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,My favourite joker is the 2019 one
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU, @Joseph Mulipola  I love how you say gaming with ryan has anger issues even tho you reply with 6 comments talking about him being triggered and how he needs to get counciling when you probably should and plus Thanos is the definition of gay he wasn't even popular until the mcu brought him in infinity war and endgame Joker however he is legendary Heath Ledgers performance as Joker was unbelievable and no one will replace him not even Joaquin Phoenix
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,You know a villain is legendary when they appear twice on the same list
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Bane should be higher every line he says is a quote
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Yeah!
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,He deserve to be in the Top 10. more then he should of.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Top 5
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Top 3
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Literally every line.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Top 1
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU, @Pop Nard  no
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Bane is a side villain bounty hunter
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU," @K GAMES  so what? so was Hannibal lector, Buffalo bill was the main villain yet Lector stole the show. also, he didn't just for Talia it was more like he worked with Talia"
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"Kylo ren but no Palpatine? It's treason, then."
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Please stop arguing with me about my dumb reply and the rules of a watchmojo video. I am not interested in arguing about it anymore.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU, @kirrikandsomtextra  Rise of skywalker (2019)
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU, @kirrikandsomtextra  true but I didn't think that was a requirement
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,it should've been anakin
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Kylo ren but not Darth Vader?

movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Sadley when it comes to the dceu they can't get it right yet.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Gone Girl was made by Fox
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,And King Ghidorah (2019)
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"Hey, iron man!!"
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Pennywise was also in 2019
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,What about Immortal Joe?
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,You also forgot about King Ghidorah. Who made his 1st American movie debut!
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU," @Aiden Kriens-Nauer  chapter 2 is 2019, the first one is 2017"
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"Lmao your profile pic is iron man which is marvel, owned by Disney. I rest my case."
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,What about Khan from Star Trek Into Darkness?
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,I wished Ledger was still alive and could see how he made the best villains of all times. Rest In Peace 😔😔
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,well then he wouldnt be the best if he still lives.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU, @JULIAN IGNACIO FALCONI ALVAREZ  it was an accident
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Yes me too really loved him as joker❤
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"Not even Pennywise can beat the Clownprinces of Crime, he is so evil that he stole two places of the list"
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Damn straight
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,But pennywise isn’t a clown.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,.......PennyWise is a primordial being of immense power...
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"Heart92a you clearly haven’t read the book then,"
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,MutterBilk Miscuit pennywise isn’t IT is. even though there technically the same.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Pennywise cannot even beat some teenagers
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU, @M W  No Joker not just kill you. He kill everything you stand for. He kill everything you was and then brings out the worse of worse. He can take the best of us and then bring out the worse of worse from it. He can make Gandhi Hitler. He did make Superman a evil dictator in Injustice series. So Joker did not just kill people. He kill each &  everything they stand for each & everything they are know for and brings out the worse
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Yashaswi Harsh Yadav those teenagers weren’t just normal teenagers. There’s a reason they beat IT.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"Captain Barbosa is the most underrated villain of the century , a truly amazing performance by the oscar winner Geoffrey Rush , equal with Jack Sparrow imo."
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"Elion Ibraimi barbosa, davy jones,"
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,I wouldn't say Barbossa is villain.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,POTC movies are mediocre but the villians are top class👌
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU, @Neeeee  the first one is great. others are eh
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,No lie I was always more blown away with Geoffrey Rush than Johnny Depp
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Nahhhh wdym davy jones best villan ever
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU," @Neeeee  the trilogy is really great, and the villains too. The fourth and fifth are cash grabs"
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Anton Chigurh is the most villainous man i ever seen on screen! He's realistic and a true killer.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Decent list but just missing one crucial character - Davy Jones fr Pirates of the Caribbean. Gave me absolute chills first time I saw Dead Man's chest and has astounding villainous presence
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,what about darth vader
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"It's not a joke, The Society is a true villain."
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Corny.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,The Rogue One's fight was possibly the coolest moment of Vader..
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,In new canon..
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Davy Jones from pirates of the caribbean should be here
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,thats what i was thinking
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,that's what I was thinking
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Definitely
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Thats what i was thinking...omg he deserves more than this
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Also jigsaw
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,bruh i love you
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,I was looking for this comment
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,This is no longer your world Jones😢
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"Loki is interesting, he's just as much a good guy as proven in his last few movies. His sacrifice in IW made me go from liking the character to loving him."
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"Bane is way too low, considering some of the entries placed above him."
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"That joke at the end almost warranted a dislike, i thought y’all really left Health Ledger’s Joker off this list"
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"""all jokers will forever be measured against Heath Ledger's performance"". Damn right, they will!"
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Willem Dafoe as the green goblin is still one of the most chilling performances you will see
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Heath Ledger......masterpiece of a performance.👌
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,I also really love Barbossa in the first Pirates of the caribbean movie 💖 Geoffrey Rush was amazing.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"In my opinion Joker and Bane from The Dark Knight, Thanos, Emperor Palpatine, Lord Voldermot, Pennywise, King Ghidorah were the best talented villains I've seen in 21 century movies."
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"Davy Jones was both written and performed extremely well, imo the best villian ever."
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Dicaprio's portrayal of Calvan Candie is by far his most underrated role. He carried the entire second act of Django Unchained.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,This may be a controversial list but I can tell you one thing: This century so far has truly had some iconic and amazing movie villains!!
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"Bane: ""No one cared who I was 'til I put on the mask.""

""We are the gods trapped in cocoons.""Missy Armitage: ""Would anyone like tea?"" ""Now, sink into the floor. Sink. You are now in the Sunken Place.""Jeremy Armitage: ""So the thing about jujitsu is...strength doesn't matter, right? It's all about this. It's a strategic game, like chess.""

movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Where is Davy Jones?? He realy deserved it to be on this List
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"Bill skarsgard made one of the most underrated performances in cinema history, he truly nailed it with Pennywise"
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,That line of dialogue still gets me teary-eyed 😭 4:27 Thank You Killmonger!👌
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Thanos coming in 2nd position was a shock .This shows how wonderful the CGI character was played by Josh Brolin.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,"*Legendary performance of a Legendary character,In a Legendary movie*  by a  Legend"
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,I have no problem with Josh Brolin's Thanos and Heath Ledger's Joker swapping spots over and over for the #1 and #2. They are in a category all their own.
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,the sad thing  two face was great but everyone is focusing at joker
movies with attractive villains recommend,4EIbHLP_zNU,Love the appreciation for Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher! Very underrated film. IMO one of Scorsese’s top

Thank you, really <3"
movies when I'm depressed recommend,U5sLtyUvL8U,"depression survivor here️well im still fighting against it tbh,but its getting better,let me tell u something...depressed people wont watch all ur recommended  movie,do you want to know why?it's because they feel EMPTY,they are NUMB inside,dont know how to react,they have NO EMOTIONS.you should change the title into sad people,or low self-esteem instead of depression.sorry to say but i got annoyed,cuz there are many people that act like they know what DEPRESSION is,but i now the fact is they dont know what it feels like,do you know how getting shot feels like?U CANT FEEL THE PAIN THAT SOMEONE HAVE,UNLESS U R IN THEIR SHOES. :sole-sama"

movies when I'm depressed recommend,U5sLtyUvL8U,"hey, dont give up. i know its the hardest thing one can imagine but stay strong and i promise you it will get better (speaking from experience). and you absolutely can go to therapy without taking meds (and i highly recommend doing so, talking to a professional is really helpful). trust me and keep going, there are a lot of things waiting to be done by you and even if you just want to watch lord of the rings all day long for a month straight than thats ok. you can do it. so if you were looking for a sign: here it is! people care about you, i care and even if you dont care about yourself right now, you will in the future and it will get easier."

movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,but thats top 10 of funniest movie ending. im always happy watching endings like this one

movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,MsMojo we always love ya
movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Ugh !!! I m such a noob and a idiot
movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,MsMojo should’ve had Dreamboy
movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Mace runner 3 end is sad but one? No way
movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Okay so with Fault in our stars. The ending is sad yes that she is left without him. But that is not the end of the story that is just where the author decided to end the book. Hazel is based off of a person in real life. And the person she is based off in real life would die one year later leaving them dead together. So is it sad yes. But the ending is not about it being sad. It is about moving on and living each moment as it your last.
movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,I feel like Bridge to Terabithia scarred a whole generation of kids who were taken to the cinema by their parents thinking it's a fun exciting adventure film.
movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"Brilliant Chaos we were drug to a live action play on a field trip! I don’t remember 99% of my field trips, but I remember that one! "
movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,NO. I can’t with this movie 
movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM, @Kate Kincaid  to be honest that sounds so nostalgic and sweet to me.
movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"Nah I read the book “Bridge to Terabithia”  before my parents attempted to take me to that dark place. They also couldn’t wreck me with Perks of a wallflower, Fault in our stars, I already knew about Romeo and Juliet, oh and the movie “Lovely Bones” my mom wanted to attempt and pull a fast one me and take me to the movies ... I had already read the book too. If it’s a movie and a teen story  or sad in any way or romancey or its going to be turned into a film I always read the book before seeing the movie because I don’t cry in public. I refuse"
movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"I remember when it released on Disney channel - it inspired two things, my fear of losing my friends, of dying by hitting my head and my attempt at drawing what Jess drew in the movie"
movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Our schoolteachers here in sweden thought it would be fun to take both classes to watch it in the cinema. I still remember that scene when he ran away and cried
movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM," @Ya gurl  When I was younger every month our local cinema had a ""kids day"" where they would pick a movie to show at a very discounted price for children. One month they picked Bridge to Terabithia. Mistakes were made."
movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"Brilliant Chaos   I think so too!  As a teacher, I was supposed to read this book with my 4th grade class.  Just thinking about it made me cry and I had to find a substitute."
movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,People really should have known the book was about before seeing the film. Disney did a bad job advertising it making it seem like it was fluff and fun and not a melancholy movie about loss.
movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,I did not register anything else from that movie after she die. Childhood me was shook.
movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Omg Five Feet Apart was the hardest for me the ending left me in tears like every time

movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,If they would have included The Death Cure instead of The Maze Runner then I'm sure SPOILER ALERTNewt's death would have been on #1 because I still cry when I'm an editor for TBS.

movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Tragic
movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"Literally most of his deaths in movies are so preventable, same as in the titanic, if rose went on one of the rescue boats or jack got his own piece of wood he wouldn’t have died lmao"
movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Yeah that’s one of the only reasons I didn’t cry
movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Luna Limon Exactly. The wood would have fit the two of them even!!
movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"Likewise, I remember watching the 1996 version in class, and we were all practically screaming at Juliet to let Romeo know that she was alive immediately, instead of just lying there and looking at him longingly right as he poisoned himself!"
movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"Yeah, that's why the story is so frustrating "
movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Luna Limon exactly if he got onto the piece of wood with rose he wouldn’t have died
movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM," @Wendy Rojas  He actually still would have, because even if the wood was big enough to hold them both, their combined body weight on it would mean that eventually it would've sunk and they both end up dying, so no matter how you look at it, someone was gonna die, and the only solution was for Jack to find a second piece of wood to hold on to"
movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"PrinceTrexus I know! It’s not like she didn’t know what he was doing, she was watching it happen"
movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Agreed she just was staring at him

movies when I'm depressed recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM, @Jessie Black  well in that case yes that movie was depressing because it was something that happened in real may be the story was fictional but still I was not sad for Bruno but for all who died without any reason.

best japanese movies recommend,eaB_NMDj5fU,The issue I have with Japanese (Domestic..not International) Movies and TV Series is their awful Marketing.

best japanese movies recommend,cUYVCba4o50,"I like the trilogy (first 3 movies) of Rurouni Kenshin live action the best. The final is a bit slower, but still good. I have yet to finally watch the beginning. I also need to finish the anime."

movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,which one do you recommend
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM, @Adolfo Alaniz  Burnt and No Reservations and The hundred-foot journey.
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,"Just now i watched Burnt , and its pure emotion."
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,"I love ""Burnt"""
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,"Same, it's VERY good!"
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,Me too
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,"Burnt was by far the best on thus list, by far."
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,You didn't mention that No reservation is an American version of Mostly Martha.. or you didn't know it! There shouldn't be 2 same movies in a top 10 list.
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,"Yeah,that should be at same no. Cook up storm should be here"
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,"I would like to add the movie ""Today's Special"". Movie about a French restaurant Sous Chef in America with Indian Heritage who wanted more but while waiting for the chance to go to Paris to train, he ended up taking over his father's Indian Restaurant in America even though he doesn't have a clue on how to cook any Indian cuisine."
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,Thanks!!
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,Mostly martha = No reservations 💖💖Need: Top 10 chef movie  part 2
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,"""Estômago"" is a brazilian movie about cooking, it's fantastic, a must watch!"
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,"LMAO ...... seriously .... Ratatouille is number one choice .... how much did the house of mouse pay for that little bit of fan service .... in all honesty it should have been #10 if it must be added to this list .... Burnt also shouldn't have been as high on the list either, it was a good movie but had some major flaws .... and what about the cooking movies from the eastern hemisphere .... Cook up a Storm was a fantastic movie .... out of the ones chosen I would have to select either Chef or The Hundred Foot Journey as #1"
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,When No Reservations totally stole that rare steak scene from Mostly Martha...
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,Whole movie is similar
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,"For your information, the movie No reservations was remade version of Mostly Martha which is an adaptation of a Book!"
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,"""Mostly Martha"" is much much better, almost every aspect."
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,"Fair list. BUT missing two greatest ""chef"" movies of all time: #2 Babbette's Feast #1 Ear Drink Man Woman ... which blows every other ""entre"" in this list out of the waterGood to include Chef and Big Night and Mostly Marta ... but why No Reservations? It's a solid remake of Mostly M, but still a remakeAnd Bradley Cooper's entry is WAY too high on this list. The end sequence where he gets his 3 stars is farcical. It takes years to garner the reputation necessary to get 3 ..."
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,I loved Big Night!
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,"No reservations, Le chef ,Julie & Julia, chef are the best 🤏"
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,Idk I loved last holiday and the food looked so good
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,"Hey thanks for the suggestion! I found it on Amazon Prime, so I’ll give it a watch"
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,The hundred foot is also good please watch it for once.
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,Where's Today's Special? It is one of the best chef films I have ever watched.
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,Thank you for the suggestion and it was a great movie 😀👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,YESS !! THIS IS MY FAVOURIT ONE TOO
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,Mostly Martha and No Reservations are like identical movies.
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,Best movie ever The Hundred Foot Journey Ratatouille
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,The Ramen Girl was one I liked. I like movies about hard work and becoming successful. That is not much of a virtue in these modern time. Success means getting a government check.
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,Omg. I was looking for that movie with subtitles before looking for this list. Can’t find it anywhere 🥲
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,You should add Boiling Point (2021)
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,"I havent seen mostly Martha, but isnt that exactly no reservation? The scene shown is exactly in no reservations."
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,I start searching about chef movies cuz I applied for prep-cook but the chef there hired me as a dishwasher which is fine. I just want to know how the resto kitchen works
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,Burnt and No reservation is my choice
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,Ratatouille no. 1? You effing kidding me? Chef should be the number one!
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,I was expecting cook up the storm
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,"Where's ""Cook Up A Storm"" 2017...?It should be on the list..."
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,Thank you so much guys...!
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,Mostly Martha is my clear favorite. No Reservations is weak remake and can be scrapped from the list. Put Tortilla Soup with Hector Elizondo its place.
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,ChefRatatouille BurntThe hundred foot journey No reservationsJulie and Julian
movies for cooking recommend,BVSKrqZ61nM,A good list but why is it that u have to narrate...let people enjoy the trailer without u spoiling the movie.

movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,Ratatouille will be forever a legendary movie...
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,Agree
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,Yup
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,EVEN IT'S A ANIMATION MOVIE
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,The word's anyone can cook
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,Yeahhh
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM, @Snaps 5  Me too
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,Agree
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,underrated movie
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,Very true
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,Yesss
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,"By been a pro-chef myself, with 40+ years experience worldwide, in my opinion, ""Chef"" is the only one that really captures the intensity of any chef life. All the drama, personal choices, and compromise are there. The attention on the details is stunning...they even give the actor burnt marks on the forearms, which is a ""trademark"" for anyone that cooks for a living ad has to deal with hot ovens every day. All the others are nice, but too ""Hollywood"" for me."
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,ZAGOR64 you said it!!
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM, @Youri de Grauw  
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,Chef is pure Food Pr0n.  But its so well edited and acted that the music and visuals tell as much story as the actors themselves.
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,"Chef is a good movie, but I think your description fits more to the movie ""Burnt"" instead. Burnt is amazing, and it captures a lot of what you mentioned in the movie."
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM," @Encoderr  ""Burnt"" is not bad, but too over-emphasized for my taste...and at times it's borderline fake; like when they pretend to be able to spot Michelin-star inspectors by the way they place an order, or drop a fork on the floor..c'mon..for real? Sure, there are drugs and dramas queens in our world, but not like that. ""Chef"" on the other hand, capture perfectly how a chef has to compromise between his ""vision"" of good food and the ""sale"" aspect of the restaurant business. We (chefs) all had to come to a term with that because at least once during our career we heard the Dustin Hoffmann line: -""It's your kitchen, but it's MY restaurant"". But hey brother, to each his own taste. TK."
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM," @ZAGOR64  I can totally agree that droppin a fork to see if someone notices is a bit weird. But Michelin inspectors actually have habits, like one ordering a la carte, while the other orders a tasting menu! I personally think that Burnt captures chefs on a competitive and professional level; while Chef is more family oriented etc. But again each to their own man! :D"
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,That’s because the actor in Chef actually cooks a lot. I believe he has a series about cooking with other actors.
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM," @PhoenixFire504  He really moves like he known what's going on in the kitchen...so it will not surprise me if he likes to cook in RL. Like I said, great performance and stunning attention to details."
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM," @Encoderr  While surely Micheline inspectors will have habits like every other human being, it'll be almost, if not, impossible to spot them. Unlike the ""Chef"" food critic blatantly famous, they're not public figures, working in incognito and very, very jealous about their ""secret"" identity. So, trust me..that's why they're so feared..because you WILL NOT know when they're at one of your tables.We can agree then, that ""burnt"" captures the agony of a wanna-be-Micheline star-chef (which it's only a small % of the Chefs worldwide) while ""Chef"" depicts the choices a great Chef need to make to survive in the restaurant BUSINESS...which BTW, it's NOT a ""family-oriented"" matter. It's as, if not more, ""professional"" level than any Michelin starred ones. Peace brother!"
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,Chef is one of my favorite movies. I was literally watching it yesterday. Jon Favreau's best film! Inspired my brother to want to get a food truck.

movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,thanks sldo yooooo i ecxpected ratatouille to be first i  o man i was iven gona put a coment ssying yoo if ratatouille is first ima laugh 
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,Everyone that’s not a real chef or can actually cook. Will most like choose burnt. I will write this carefully I believe Chef to be number one
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,"It's been a while but ""The Woman on Top"" with Penelope Cruz playing a Brazilian chef always makes me want to dance and cook and drink caipirinhas at the same time. :-)"
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,"What a shame that only American movies were included, there are many many better movies out there! Some mentioned in the comments are Soul Kitchen, Eat drink man woman, some others: Kamome Diner, Tampopo, Io sono l'amore, The Lunchbox... Cinema doesn't stop at Hollywood ;)"
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,about to say the same... would only save from that list Ratatouille xD
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,The 100 Foot Journey
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,East side Sushi and Ustad Hotel !
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,"yeah, the movies you mentioned are awesome. Asia has some amazing movies about food. The opening sequences of Eat Drink Man Woman is mouthwatering...I'd like to add Estomago to your list, a delightful movie about food and...other things. from Brazil."
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,Amen!
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,"I also recommend Le Grand Chef, 2007 Korean movie."
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,EXO - L agree
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,LOVE Tampopo
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,"I think 'Cooking up a storm' was a great movie, a little dramatic but none the less a good film about Gourmet vs Soulfood"
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM," @S S  wow I totally botched the name ""Cook up a storm"" 2017"
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,„Chef“ & „The hundred foot journey“ - must watch for everyone who loves food or/and cooking!!! „Chef“ is actually one of my favourit movies of all time 
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,Little forest should be included in the list... Such a beautiful seasonal food journey 
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,"I agree with this list though Hundred Foot Journey I never heard of.  Look up Diner Rush, my personal favorite.  Italian mobsters with a trendy New York restsuraunt run by his son who doesn't see eye to eye with his Godfather daddy.  I'd also suggest Eat Drink Man Woman.  A Chinese flick, in Mandarin, about one of the country's best chef and his 3 daughters, and their love life stories shared over the family meal.  Hilarious with some great b roll footage of some classic techniques and dishes with not a lot of culture shock, it feels very familiar."

movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,It is amazing and beautiful 
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,I was gonna riot if Ratatouille wasn’t included in this list  such a good movie
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,"All great films, but Chef is wonderful, and with an exhilarating soundtrack."
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,"so ""chef"" is basicaly about tony stark let happy chase the dream with black widow as happy's bodyguard.."
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,"Fun story about this is, the real life chef that inspired Jon Favreau to produce this movie, Roy Choi, catered for the Avengers cast while they were filming, even before the movie Chef was planned. That's how the whole idea came together, taking a little from Roy's story. He also trained Jon in cooking and was a consultant for the recipes and methods used, that's why this movie is so spot-on, there's an actual chef supervising it."
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,"Chef is basically what Happy was doing during the five year interim in Endgame when Tony ""retired""."

movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,Yes you're right chef is the movie I watched 100 times and still feel not enough. Simply a best movie.
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,No Reservations has to be the most hallmark cooking movie I’ve ever seen in my life
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,the worst part is that is based on a German movie called Mostly Martha which is 100 times better
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,Soo true....
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,If you want to see a sweet simple movie which ties u with your screen then go for Hundred foot journey. Its hell sweet
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,"100 foot apart was such a great movie, if you love food please watch this I promise you won't be disappointed."
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,We need more movies about foods 
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,"'No Reservations' is based off the German film 'Mostly Martha'! They are both good, but in my personal opinion the original German film is better and should be there instead!"
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,"“Food is a memory” “Every bites take you home”"
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,Chocolat and Just Desserts should have made the list too! ️
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,Julie and Julia is just a classic. So annoyed it got removed from my Netflix account
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,Chef is one of my fav movies. Extremely underrated
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,Does anyone consider The Ramen Girl cooking-based. She learned to be a ramen chef.
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,To not have 'cook up a storm' on this list is almost criminal
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,"I'm sorry, I have nothing against Chef, I  think it's a fantastic movie, a great movie, but for me Ratatouille was, is, and most likely will forever be number one ."
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,Watched them all. . .  Ratatouille is the most inspiring !!
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,"1. ""Politiki kouzina"" by Tasos Boulmetis, international title ""A Touch of Spice"". 2. ""Babette's feast"" by Gabriel Axel. 3. ""Les Saveurs du Palais"" by Christian Vincent. 4.""Soul Kitchen"" by Fatih Akin. For real foodies."
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,Burnt. Julie and Julia. The hundred foot journey. No reservations. Ratatouille. Chef.
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,"Beautiful video. One of the best compilations I've seen in a long time. I watched the whole video without batting an eye, even with my goldfish attention span"
movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,"I know this is subjective, but I feel that Ang Lee’s Eat Drink Man Woman should have been mentioned"

movies for cooking recommend,VVvnUvWWWvM,Burnt looks like gordon Ramsey got his own movie
movies for cooking recommend,hl-L9LUCBNk,"A great montage, now I have to see some of those films again, thank you 👍"
movies for cooking recommend,hl-L9LUCBNk,it's like cinematic free association but specifically for food. Loved how this compilation was put together
movies for cooking recommend,hl-L9LUCBNk,"It wasn't the best movie ever, but I was hoping to see Simply Irresistible with Sarah Michelle Gellar. I remember getting it because of the magical culinary scenes a little more than the love story. I still enjoy watching it on the occasional lazy, late Sunday morning"
movies for cooking recommend,hl-L9LUCBNk,"This was so beautiful and makes me fall in love with the food, culinary arts, culture and enjoying eating. 100%"
movies for cooking recommend,hl-L9LUCBNk,"Thank you for putting this together, such a joy to watch!"
movies for cooking recommend,hl-L9LUCBNk,"That transition between ""Spanglish"" and ""When Harry Met Sally""... genius editing! This entire video was beautifully put together!"
movies for cooking recommend,hl-L9LUCBNk,There really is something so comforting and humanizing about characters and cooking/food it tells you a lot about the texture of a character but also the world they inhabit.
movies for cooking recommend,hl-L9LUCBNk,"Nicely edited, smooth, and cleanly spliced together"
movies for cooking recommend,hl-L9LUCBNk,"You've done a great job! I'll definitely bookmark this and watch it every time I don't feel like eating. However, I do agree that you should put more scenes from Babette's Feast. Thank you for the montage!"
movies for cooking recommend,hl-L9LUCBNk,The choice of clips and editing of this video is absolutely brilliant!
movies for cooking recommend,hl-L9LUCBNk,"I watched this whole thing instead of studying for my exam. No regrets. Maybe a bit cause now I'm starving, and maybe later after I get my exam results. But for now... my soul has been comforted 🤤🙏"
movies for cooking recommend,hl-L9LUCBNk,Best food porn ever!! Love how all the scenes was put together 😋 😍🤤  Hope there will be more like this 🙏

sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,but thats top 10 of funniest movie ending. im always happy watching endings like this one
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"or Tomorrow, When the War Began"
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,MsMojo we always love ya
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Ugh !!! I m such a noob and a idiot
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,MsMojo should’ve had Dreamboy
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Mace runner 3 end is sad but one? No way
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Okay so with Fault in our stars. The ending is sad yes that she is left without him. But that is not the end of the story that is just where the author decided to end the book. Hazel is based off of a person in real life. And the person she is based off in real life would die one year later leaving them dead together. So is it sad yes. But the ending is not about it being sad. It is about moving on and living each moment as it your last.
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,If Juliet had just opened her freaking mouth Romeo wouldn’t have died lol
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Tragic
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"Literally most of his deaths in movies are so preventable, same as in the titanic, if rose went on one of the rescue boats or jack got his own piece of wood he wouldn’t have died lmao"
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Yeah that’s one of the only reasons I didn’t cry
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Luna Limon Exactly. The wood would have fit the two of them even!!
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"Likewise, I remember watching the 1996 version in class, and we were all practically screaming at Juliet to let Romeo know that she was alive immediately, instead of just lying there and looking at him longingly right as he poisoned himself!😣"
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"Yeah, that's why the story is so frustrating 😕"
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Luna Limon exactly if he got onto the piece of wood with rose he wouldn’t have died
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM," @Wendy Rojas  He actually still would have, because even if the wood was big enough to hold them both, their combined body weight on it would mean that eventually it would've sunk and they both end up dying, so no matter how you look at it, someone was gonna die, and the only solution was for Jack to find a second piece of wood to hold on to"
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"PrinceTrexus I know! It’s not like she didn’t know what he was doing, she was watching it happen"
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Agreed she just was staring at him

sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Amen
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Ive watched this movie so many times and cry everytime
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM, @Jessie Black  that one was not love story. And we are talking about sad not depressing.
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM," @You are right But  pretty sure the title of the video is teen movies, not love stories. Also sorry if I ruined the conversation."
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Without any doubt
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM, @Jessie Black  well in that case yes that movie was depressing because it was something that happened in real may be the story was fictional but still I was not sad for Bruno but for all who died without any reason.
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,1: A walk to remember2: Romeo + Juliet3: Five feet apart4: The fault in our stars5: Bridge to Terabithia6: Me and Earl and the dying girl7: Call me by your name8: If I stay9: The maze runner 10: The perks of being a wallflower

sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM, @NABIYA  Ikr its beautiful 😭. But I merely just named the movies in the video. 😊
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Me before you isn’t about teens that’s why....But your right that fuckin movie gets meevery time......😭😭😭
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,If they would have included The Death Cure instead of The Maze Runner then I'm sure SPOILER ALERTNewt's death would have been on #1 because I still cry when I'm an editor for TBS.
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Remember me why isn't that one

sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Supernatural? ending
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,I feel like Bridge to Terabithia scarred a whole generation of kids who were taken to the cinema by their parents thinking it's a fun exciting adventure film.
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"Brilliant Chaos we were drug to a live action play on a field trip! I don’t remember 99% of my field trips, but I remember that one! 😭😭"
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,NO. I can’t with this movie 💔
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM, @Kate Kincaid  to be honest that sounds so nostalgic and sweet to me.
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"Nah I read the book “Bridge to Terabithia”  before my parents attempted to take me to that dark place. They also couldn’t wreck me with Perks of a wallflower, Fault in our stars, I already knew about Romeo and Juliet, oh and the movie “Lovely Bones” my mom wanted to attempt and pull a fast one me and take me to the movies ... I had already read the book too. If it’s a movie and a teen story  or sad in any way or romancey or its going to be turned into a film I always read the book before seeing the movie because I don’t cry in public. I refuse"
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"I remember when it released on Disney channel - it inspired two things, my fear of losing my friends, of dying by hitting my head and my attempt at drawing what Jess drew in the movie"
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Our schoolteachers here in sweden thought it would be fun to take both classes to watch it in the cinema. I still remember that scene when he ran away and cried😭
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM," @Ya gurl  When I was younger every month our local cinema had a ""kids day"" where they would pick a movie to show at a very discounted price for children. One month they picked Bridge to Terabithia. Mistakes were made."
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"Brilliant Chaos   I think so too!  As a teacher, I was supposed to read this book with my 4th grade class.  Just thinking about it made me cry and I had to find a substitute."
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,People really should have known the book was about before seeing the film. Disney did a bad job advertising it making it seem like it was fluff and fun and not a melancholy movie about loss.
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,I did not register anything else from that movie after she die. Childhood me was shook.
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"I watched "" five feet apart"" yesterday.. And only God knows How much I cried though out the movie..This movie broke my heart. The girl doesn’t even want new lungs because she knew she has to live alone.that was so heart breaking 😢😢"
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,It makes me cry at the end and I have no heart if you read the book it's less sad
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM, @Teresa Trento  Midnight sun was heartbreaking too....She knew she was gonna die and she lived life without any fear..I wish everyone could live life like her.
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"I read that last year with my class, i started BAWLING in class. it was so embarrassing but i couldn't help it, it was so sad!!"

sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Five Feet Apart and Fault in our Stars never fail to make me cry. The scene when Will says goodbye to Stella I bawled my eyes out😭😭

sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,FR
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,You literally don't undertsand what literally means.
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,I cried half through the fault in our Stars. I was sobbing so loud in the movie theater that I swore never to watch those kind of movies in public again. And the scene that puts me to tears everytime in a walk to remember is when Landon breaks out in tears in front of his father and tells him that his girlfriend is dying.
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"Yeah the speech he gave was good, but for sure the most gut wrenching moment was him begging his dad to save her and realising he couldn't"
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"If a book or movie says ""John Green"" or ""inspired by the book by John Green"", you know you're gonna end up crying in your room with a bowle of ice cream and a spoon in your hands"

sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,True
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Midnight Sun was definitely the hardest one for me. I cried so hard when Katie told her dad she wanted to go with Charlie to the marina and I cried even more when they threw her ashes in the sea and Charlie read the letter she wrote for him
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,And when her song played in the radio 😭
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Me too. The song they play when she is at the boat and throwing her ashes into the sea… that definitely really goe me crying the whole time
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"Five feet apart killed me, I was a mess at the end"
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Five Feet Apart and Avengers: Endgame BROKE ME
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,The Fault in our Stars literally left me with tears and obsession with the novel itself.
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,Fun fact: Five Feet Apart has the best Soundtracks.
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"People don't talk about ""Before I Fall"" enough!!! When it came out I thought it would be an interesting movie for me and my friend to go see, but we did not expect THAT ending. We were both shocked, mad, and crying at what happened. It honestly broke me for a minute. HOWEVER, I HIGHLY recommend it. The movie is PHENOMENAL, even the ending, it's just not the ending that I wanted or expected."

sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"The perks of being a wallflower changed the way I view life, and I've watched it a bunch of times and still in each of those times it still gives me these unexplainable feeling."
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,The Perks of Being a Wall Flower is the only show/movie that I've seen that accurately portrays what a suicide attempt is like. It's incredibly similar to my own. Which is why it is number 1 on my list.
sad movies recommend,Y1rOI35m1AM,"I never knew why Cmbyn was such an emotional ending until I realised that Elio was just a project for Oliver. While Elio was in love for the first time Oliver just thought of a nice interesting project with Elio. Oliver moved on, forgot about his short summer romance and got married. Elio couldn't let go and still loves his first lover. This is what heartbreak feels like"

sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I cry every single time. Ugly crying.
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Coco is number 1 for me, gets me good every time!"
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"What about the ending to Shadow the Hedgehog (2005) the opening 40 seconds of"" Never Turn Back"". Makes me well up with tears. also makes me feel a little happy inside."
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8, @bard the nascar fanatic dragon  I havent seen Sonic the Hedgehog.
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8," @Rio Toews  you mean shadow the hedgehog? it's a video game from 2005. I said that because of ""Never Turn Back."""
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8, @bard the nascar fanatic dragon  ohhh okay yeah I don't think I have played it lol sorry
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8, @Rio Toews  never turn back is the closing song.
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"""Crying helps me slow down and obsess over the weight of life's problems."" -Sadness, Inside Out"
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,“I wish I knew how to quit you”  That line just hits different
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,jack fucking twist broke my heart
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I agree, Jake and Heath are such fantastic, charismatic actors, and that line hits me right in the feels! "
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,what movie you guys are talking about?what is its name?
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8, @BeetleJuice  brokeback mountain
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Brokeback Mountain is such a beautifully written tragic love story... Amazing acting by Jake & Heath, beautifully shot, and masterfully crafted by the amazing Ang Lee."
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,️️️
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,It truly does
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"""Titantic"" never fails to make me weep. When Rose utters ""I'll never let go, Jack, that's my cue to bawl uncontrollably! "
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Agreed. Such a beautiful line from a heartbreaking epic.
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"The she LETS go! As a younger girl watching I was like ""you let him...go"" yt growing up, wiser you get the significance of that line. She will never let him go.....from her heart. "
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8," @Kerry Ann  Too true, you never really forget your first love. I did feel a little sorry for Rose's deceased husband, though, since she'd presumably lived a long and happy life with him as well."
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,she could’ve moved over 
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"and the fact that he doesn't necessarily mean never let go of him, but to never let go of her freedom and lust for life"
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8, @Nikki B  yeah I got the film ending much clearer as I watched it as I got older. When I was young and seen it I took it a bit too literal! 
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,When I saw it I laughed at that part because she says she never let go and then does. But I cried at the very end when rose dies and goes back to jack in the ship along with all the other people that died.
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8, @celestedits  24 years later and people are still talking about that controversy.
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I felt so bad bc i laughed when i watched it
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I feel ""Life is beautiful"" deserves much higher position on this list. That movie is devestating!! I watched it as a teenager and it took me several days to recover emotionally "
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,The Boy in the Striped Pajamas. I can never forget sobbing my eyes out to that movie.
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I just commented on that one after not seeing it, and here it is. It made me completely sad and feeling a bit uneasy about our species."
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I just recorded that movie because I haven't seen it in years. I just have to prepare myself first. It's playing on HBO and just found out it's on Hulu too, incase you want to see it again."
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Movie name
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"The movie that holds a record for making me cry three times in just 120 minutes is ‘Train to Busan’. This may sound weird but this one was literally a masterpiece. After knowing the genre, I never thought it could be this much amazing because I was tired of watching such movies but I fell for this one and I fell hard. Apart from that ,the editing, direction, storyline are all fabulous.I don’t guarantee that while watching this you will cry but I’m sure you won’t regret watching this."
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,yooo thank GOD someone wrote this. That movie kills me
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,That ending had me bawling like a baby
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,For me it will always be 'Marley and me'.I've just lost a dog which was with us for 9 years :( The sadness is beyond.
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I feel thatI cried for our dog when it died
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"This is underrated, but I cried to ""The Theory of Everything."""
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I’m in tears the last 15-20 minutes of Titanic every time, but when Rose says “I’ll never let go, I promise” I’m sobbing uncontrollably."
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Good collection of films. I'd even add The Notebook, Love Story, P.S. I Love You,  Boys Don't Cry and Blue Valentine. I also loved Gone With The Wind...it bring tears to the eye at the doomed love story of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler"
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Blue valentine was hard to watch just seen now their life fell apart man that got me
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Saving Private Ryan to me has plenty of emotional moments from the start to end that blends a perfect balance of sad and respect.  With the song Hymn to the Fallen playing adds that mood. James ""Tell her that when you found me that I was here and I was with the only brothers I had left. There is no reason I would abandon them."" When an old James Ryan speaks to Captain Miller and asks his wife ""Tell me that I led a  good life. Tell me that I am a good man!"""
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"""Marley & Me"" and ""Toy Story 3"" both made my mom cry. ""Titanic"" is of my all-time favorites. Also, the ending of ""Driving Miss Daisy"" made me cry so much."
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I teared up just watching the scenes for A Walk to Remember, Bride to Terabithia and Marley and Me so I'd definitely say that they're tear jerkers!"
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I cant believe the notebook isnt even an honourable mention. That film gets me every time
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I am always a blubbering mess after watching The Notebook. Even though I know whats going to happen.  Apart from A Bridge to Terabithia the others on the list just seemed a bit meh
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I haven't watched the entire video yet, I guessed it would be right at the top. There's plenty of movies I wished were on the list.The Other Side of the MountainBrian's SongSomething for JoeyThe ChampI could go on and on."
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I've waited two weeks for this list just so I know Hatchi can get the recognition it deserves.
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I always bawl like a baby whenever I watch Hachi and Marley & me. I even  teared up  watching the clips just now.
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I was so glad to see #1 on this list. Not enough people are aware of it and it's such a well made great sweet movie.
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"A lot of Nicolas Sparks’ movies made me cry, not only “Walk to remember”, but also “The Last Song” or “The Best of Me”. I believe, that Coco should be mentioned, by the end I was crying a lot..."
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,My best friend and I went to see Me Before You at the brand new Movie Tavern when it first came out. We left the movie theater SOBBING and the poor waiter asked us if we were ok. We both gave a blubbering “Noooo” as we quickly left the theater 
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"That's what i love about these movies, they have such emotional scenes and music in them that not even i can resist shedding a tear!"
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"""A Walk To Remember"" is brutal, like genuinely brutal. It lures you in with youthful love and a story that twists and turns for good and bad, and ends with both in a joyful devestation."
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I cried like a baby when Gus told Hazel Grace that his cancer is back he went for a check up and his body lit up like a Christmas tree. I honestly didn't see it coming. I tear up thinking about it now even.
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I'm such a emotional wreck when it comes to The Green Mile, My Girl and anything with dying dogs! ️ cry like baby!"
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I watched hachi twice and still makes me cry.
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Five Feet Apart should be in the honorable mentions at least, it simply destroyed me"
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"If I could add one movie to this list, even as an honorable mention, it has to be ""Love And Other Drugs."" It hits me in ways similar to ""A Walk To Remember."""
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Some titles to consider for part two: The Hours, Evening, Always, The Color Purple, It's My Party, The Joy Luck Club, and Dolores Claiborn. Most importantly of all there's The Lord of the Rings trilogy."
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"If you don't cry during Hachi, u are a soulless monster !"
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Life is beautiful is 1 of my favorite movies. I know it sad from the beginning but the way the characters drive the story makes everything more hopeful wanting 2 believe things will get better. The humor is great but loving but gave me a punch of what happens but a good ending 4 his son.
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"""A walk to remember"" always breaking my heard "
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I think that ""The boy in the striped pajamas"" deserves a place  on the list. Its a heart breaking story set in world war two that follows a little boy who finds out about a concentration camp close to his home that his father runs. There's a lot more to the story but it's really good"
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I love 'Me Before You' the best love story ever!
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,This video should be called “10 movies that are great but you’ll never want to watch again”
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,The Notebook was a sob fest from the first act! I started crying 15 minutes in and never stopped. How in the world could this movie have been snubbed!
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Toy Story 3 and E.T. are the kind of movies that makes me happy cry about childhood. Forrest Gump, Shawshank and The Color Purple make me happy cry because they show you that you can overcome anything; teasing, neglect and abuse."
sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Watching ""Marley & me"" i thought i would laugh , but ended up making me cry a lot"

sad movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Moulin Rouge always gets me. It's no spoiled she dies, he tells you at the very beginning she is dead. But when she does, I cry in absolute devastation as if I didn't see it coming. The movie itself is absolutely stunning and such a treat for the eyes and ears."

sad movies recommend,kYjH9AtpdhE,Agree
sad movies recommend,kYjH9AtpdhE,Titanic is one of the greats it will always be.
sad movies recommend,kYjH9AtpdhE,Before trilogy is rhe best movie but the way final part progress it gets more real and more sad. First part is still the most feel good movie I say.

sad movies recommend,kYjH9AtpdhE,appreciate your taste in movies
sad movies recommend,kYjH9AtpdhE,One Day is a sad movie but good Anne Hathaway is great for this role it is shocking that she dies at the end because she finally gets together with Dex and they are happy. They should have been together along
sad movies recommend,kYjH9AtpdhE,Titanic is the Best of All time from These sad romantic films.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,My high school modern history teacher made a really good point about the boy in the striped pyjamas and how everyone was saying it was so tragic because Bruno wasn’t even supposed to be in there and died anyway. I’ll never forgot when she burst into tears in front of us and said “none of them were supposed to be there”
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Maddie Jones wow that’s really deep
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,damn this is really depressing
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"I don't think people get upset because they think Bruno wasn't supposed to be in there. I think people get upset because that is what it took for an SS guard to realize what was happening to all those innocent people. A lot of people, including German soldiers, had no idea what was actually going on and you can see their reactions to videos of prisoners getting liberated. Many are devestated. I believe it shows just how blind many of us are and we just follow suit. They couldn't tell the difference which in realization reminds us we're all the same."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,That's really depressing
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Incredible Mike What lies? Are you a crazy conspiracy theorist who is going to say it never happened?
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"JP  what they mean is during the time people in Germany, Russia, etc. had to serve in the military.  Some places straight up drafted people.  From there the average person was cut off from the world and fed only the information Hitler etc. wanted them to know.  So by the end many (certainly not all - fucking monsters) of these people had no actual idea what was happening.  Drones were not a thing, the net was not a thing, your news was word of mouth, propaganda, and newspapers which were government controlled.  Not every man that served directly worked at a camp - if they didn't they would only know what was happening through word of mouth OR if they got their hands on foreign news without getting punished.  I am forever grateful to my grandparents/family for seeing through the lies - right after the fall of the Romanovs when the government starting making their lists and drafting men; they were able to escape the Ukraine before they were shuttled into one of the camps.  I always watch these and think about what amazing people they were (I never met them; my dad was orphaned by 14) - if it hadn't been for them my father never would have been born."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Exactly..Both of them were playing and then Bruno playfully says we will find your father.  And ironically ends up there.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,So true
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,such a deep movie i felt really bad for bruno
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"Oh my gosh, she's so right. None of them should've been there :'-("
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,‘The Green Mile’ should be in honorable mentions. That movie wrecked my emotion so hard.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Even When Stephen King Is A Horror Making Stories It Writes Good Drama
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"After reading the book, the movie was just child's play..I got physically sick reading the book and i cried."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"that ""The Green Mile"" should be the most depressing of all"
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Legend Dragon yes like how good The Shawshank Redemption is.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"ArcticAzylum I personally enjoy watching movies more than reading books, as my English is limited. Stephen King is undoubtedly respected author."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,ArcticAzylum what was some details of the book ?
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Agree
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Really? Really I can watch that movie over and over
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,I think that a monster calling is the saddest movie ever. I was crying so hard when he said he just wanted his mothers cancer to be over with
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,oh same. that movie wrecked me. never gonna recover from it
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,You know this list is gonna be stacked when “Grave of the fireflies” is only at number 9
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,I actually didnt feel that much prolly because i expected so much and A Silent Voice almost made me cry so i have HIGH EXPECTATION
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8, @LEE  guess you've never experienced bullying
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Gravrme of the fireflies overrated
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8, @Fan4every1 lol  I don't think silent voice is that sad😅
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Grave of fireflies I could watch twice but still sad
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8, @OTAKU GAMING  your power levels are showing
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"The pathetic thing is that you expecting A Silent Voice in the list as one of ""Depressing movies that you can only watch once"". Bruh. Your standard."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Grave of the fireflies hit way harder than Requiem for me.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"It all depends on the experience. As someone who has seen drugs kill people he loves, that movie hit way harder. It felt closer to home."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8, @The collector  I've never done drugs or have hardly seen anybody do them but the ending of the movie had me shaking
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,And also Schindler's list
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,GROW UP THEN
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,What is requiem?
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8," @The collector  I've literally had friends overdose and pass away, and still find Grave of the Fireflies a much sadder film simply because it's a true story"
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8, @A curious Jaggi  I agreeTerrible film
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8," @The EngNeer  I mean, both movies are based on reality.  Same as the boy in the stripped pajamas. Saying one is real and one is not is simply not true. Both are based on books that are a semi recollection of tales the author experienced. And both represent the reality of millions of people. I’m not dissing grave of the fireflies. I think it’s an amazing and really powerful movie. But claiming requiem is a bad movie and that the other is better because it’s “real” is not a great argument I would say. Both achieve what they sought out to achieve."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8, @A curious Jaggi  That’s the point of the movie.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,The final scene in Grave of the Fireflies is literally jaw dropping. Heart-breaking story but so beautifully made and written. Not too many films listed here even come close even though they are excellent in their own right.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,I had a hunch that it'd have a sad ending but I was not prepared for THAT.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Yes every single scene is masterpiece
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8," @Tristo Smitty  pride, both of him and of all the people around him"
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"Too bad it didn't show the devastation Japan inflicted on Asia during the war, which was far worse than many think."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8," @D.H. Kim  yes, it only shows 2 orphan suffering from war. And in no way the movie ever support what their government did"
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,I watched it with my sister and I cried while she's here. 😥
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8, @Tristo Smitty  he's son of an Soldier! He knows the value of self respect and Pride 😇.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"""Hachiko"" should have been included in this list. I have never cried for a dog movie my whole life except for this."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Yes
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Exactly!
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,The mom's crying when she realizes Bruno died in the camp still gives me chills even though I watched the movie last year in world history.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8," @George W  she's a great, and beautiful actress."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Mer Derer yea I felt bad for Bruno but the parents deserved it
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Mer Derer yea but she could have like broken up with him
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8," @Pepper  she did, they were moving away the day he died, have you not seen the film?"
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Same here
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Mer Derer same it was so freaking sad i wanted to cry so bad
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"Yeah, it was sort of his mother’s fault for letting him “swing” outside But that was really sad still :’C"
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"Jack Scanlon(shmuel), David Thewlis(Bruno's dad),... they got many of talented actor in this movie 👍👍"
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,I remember watching this with my class in grade 6
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"Personally, I feel like Schindler’s list should be number 1. Requiem for a dream was undoubtably depressing, but Schindler’s list is just emotionally haunting."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"Exactly!Requiem for a Dream is uncomfortable to watch, but Schindler's List is really really sad and heartbreaking."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,that’s what i was thinking
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,I think it was no. 1 in the previous incarnation of this clip.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,I´m surprised Twelve Years a Slave was not on this list.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"@Zeku 2.0, I thought so too"
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,If you know anything about the world of drug addiction you should agree that Requiem for a Dream is a violent and unrelenting ride and possibly the most visceral film ever made.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,It is the saddest film of all time
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,There is no comparison for movies like these. I mean these movies are the most depressing in there own ways.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,But have you seen Sophie’s Choice or the Angel of Death film on Mengele? Both of those will make you cry for days after watching it. They never should’ve happened in real life let alone had to be movie.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"I agree. While Requiem for a Dream is disturbing, Schindler's List is based on real events."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"Throughout my teenage years, I found myself unaffected by most horror movies. Following Requiem for a Dream, I couldn't sleep for 2 nights and found myself in the pits of despair, reliving the hopeless narratives of each protagonist. Surely, one of the most harrowing movies I will ever see."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"I agree, I’ve never had issues with horror films but the ones that depict war and mental illness stay with you for days"
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,I definitelly agree with the number one of this list.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Gage's death from the original Pet Sematary got me shaken up as well.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,That movie sucks lol
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8, @The EngNeer  every sad movie comment section has that one edgelord who thinks not being emotional is cool
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Ellen Burstyn's portrayal of Sarah Goldfarb was heart-shattering.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"Not only Requiem for a Dream was distressing, but also more scary than any horror flick."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,I couldn’t agree more.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Grave of Fireflies makes all of these films seem like they had happy endings
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,have you SEEN the other movies?!
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8," @Rika24  Of course, but I didn't have my soul ripped out of my chest and then have it dragged across rock and glass, when I watched any of the other films. None of the other films made me feel dead inside or made me sob cry or made me question the existenceince of God , some of them even had hope in them.  In fact , after Grave of Fireflies, once I found out it was a true story, I doubt there is a God"
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8, @WickedMo13  Boy in the Stripes Pajamas has stuck with my because of its gut wrenching ending and I forbid myself to watch itself again.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Have you seen requiem for a dream...
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Have you ever watched come and see?
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8," @WickedMo13  I didn’t cry. But I still felt devastated and depressed. The type of horror of that film was not one that was meant to give you tears. Also, your response has nothing to do with what I said. You said that grave of the fireflies made requiem and the rest look like they had a happy ending. Which isn’t true at all. The descent of the two main characters in GOTF is tragic, yes. But it’s not so much more tragic than the fall of the characters in requiem as their lives turn into a living hell. Your hyperbole does not make sense."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8, @ロンッロンッ  Come and See didn’t make me cry but it was still a soul crushing experience for me. Seeing the perspective of the Belarusian boy Florya was so devastating to see his mental and physical decline throughout the entire film. The end where he shoots the portrait of hitler and wishes to reverse him and his effects of WW2 through the real footage montage of Nazi influence and act’s was some of the most powerful cinematography I’ve witnessed. Come and See is one of the few films that show what war and its effects truly is and never romanticizes it a single second
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8, @クセが強い!!!  hi
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8, @WickedMo13  U are right bro.There is definetly a god
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,@WickedMo13 so this movie changed your view on God. It must be easy to convince you
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"I think "" Grave of the fireflies"" deserves a better place. I saw this movie and I was just so broken that I couldn't sleep. I cried an entire day. And when i think of it, I cry again it's just soo sad and heartbreaking."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,i watched it two hours ago and I feel the same. I'll never be the same again
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Agreed. Never had a movie crush me like that one
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"If that movie messed you up, never watch requiem for a dream, especially if you know someone that went through or is going through drug addiction"
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"My parents let me watch it when I was seven, I went after viewing My Neighbour Totoro.I literally cried myself to sleep with my dad for the next 3 days."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8, @i v y  same here
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"I remember I KNEW EXACTLY what was going to happen before I wacthed it, yet I still sobbed and couldn't sleep for a day"
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"As much as I love anime,  I will NEVER watch this lol"
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8, @the tf   Watched both. Requiem for a Dream is no way near as sad as Grave of the Fireflies.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"Yes, it didn't make me cry but it made my heart sank. Imagine dying for something they don't have control with and they are literally children."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"I'll never forget the first time I learnt about the Rwandan Genocide. As a South African, it hurts to know that such an awful thing happened right as our country was coming out of its own struggle (apartheid). Unfortunately, the Rwandan genocide is spoken of far less than apartheid, but I'm glad there is a movie that is almost able to depict how brutal it must have been. I wish the world knew more about African history"
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"I was barely a teenager when this was going on. There would be a five minute blip on World News Tonight. I just thought ""why aren't we doing anything to stop this""  I had never experienced such sadness,  compassion, or deep DEEP desire to stop what was happening. At 14 y/o I didn't fully understand what was actually happening but I knew enough to know that it was wrong in so many ways and showed just how awful humans can be towards each other. It was a hell of a lesson in humanity."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"""THE GREAVE OF THE FIREFLIES"" destroyed me. This movie is so painful to watch because we get into the characters and see them slowely sinking into the darkness. We see them suffer harder and harder. I've watched that movie a year ago. That was the first and the last time. Whenever i think of that movie, I kinda get super sad and feel like doing nothing all of a sudden. Man that movie is amazing. Its so fkn painful oh my god.."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Watched it when i was 9...i couldn't sleep for dayss🤧🤧🤧
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Grave of the Fireflies***
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Ghibli makes the best anime
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,My Japanese language teacher had us watch it. I was a crying mess those 2 days in class. it was so sad.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Damn. I still can't bring myself to watch this movie.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Yeah I watched it last night. It was really sad
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,I watched this and barefoot gen.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,It is in my Top Ten fave films of all time and I have only ever watched it once.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,I watch when I was having exam next day it just kept me thinking during exam time
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,If his aunt ain't selfish they'd survive.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"Nothing made me cry more than the end of Schindler’s list. When he realizes he could he could have saved more lives: “I could have saved one more!” Sobbing, it really wrenched my heart."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,True. I watched it in 7th grade and hardly remembered anything. Now  rewatched it a few weeks ago and it hit me hard.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,I’m seventh grade ? That movie had like ALOT of violence and nudity
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,“I didn’t do enough”“You did so much”
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Omg that almost made me sob but somehow I didn’t cry but it almost had me sobbing!
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Yup. That scene just tore me apart.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,SAME!! That part always gets me.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"omg i know, i still remember that scene and start crying. like he'd already given practially all he had, the few things he still had were what would help him survive once the war was over yet he didn't care, to him if it meant saving at least one more life it would've been worth it"
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8, @Xander Kubec  The movie is actually rated 12 in Germany.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"I think Schindler was talking about the girl in the red dress as in one more life, as it was the moment he saw her dead that broke him."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"We watched ""Life is beautiful"" with our class. The other boys wanted to act tough so they didn't pay attention so they wouldn't cry, but the girls  and 2 boys, me and my boyfriend cried.."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,You watch movies in your class? How lucky
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8," @poopyman7257  yea but it was for a topic, the holocaust/ WW2 so yea but we don't usually watch movies I mean sometimes at the end of the year when our school work is done and we have nothing left to do"
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,thats amazing
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,I watched this movie for my Italian class...from the time they catch Guido to the end I bawl my eyes out. Such a great movie!
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,life is beautiful was the fist movie i ever cried to it broke my heart
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,same
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,A make sense you cry from movie When you is gay
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,I cried for a week after seeing it. I wish my class could see it bc its so sad :(
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,I'm Rwandan and I have relatives who experienced what is seen in Hotel Rwanda. I'm so glad we've moved on from that. Some of them even pretended to be dead and were thrown into a river.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,I love how everyone is collectively agreeing on the fact that nothing can beat grave of the fireflies. Ever
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"I rarely cry. I didn't cry when I had cancer. but I sure cried my ass off when I saw Schindler's List. I just couldn't stop crying and I didn't wanna stop either. Although haunting, it's my favorite movie of all time, and I carry the lessons taught by it till this day. I can't stand seeing people - including myself- waste food anymore, or spend money with meaningless things. It may be a very sad movie, but it's also unbelievably enlightening, and therefore its worth watching it again from time to time, to make sure we don't forget the psst and commit the same mistakes in the present or the future. The only downside from watching it again is that you may not feel the same strong emotions you felt in the first time, since it won't be a novelty anymore. Nonetheless it's still a masterpiece."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,How is “The Pianist” not on here? The wheelchair scene was scarring
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,I had nightmares for weeks after we saw that in school. I still can't look when that scene comes on.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,i practically had a breakdown after watching that man being thrown and then the nazis running over the people with the car
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,EXACTLY
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,And his breakdown was tragic
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"The Pianist, Schindlers List, and Hotel Rwanda are the 3 movies that had me crying way after the credits rolled. Not just tearing up. But actually sobbing like a child, with moans, with many tears drizzling down my face. These are the 3 most powerful films i have ever seen."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,EXactly
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,that was the funniest part of the movie actually
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,they told him to stand up... he didin't.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Yeah that movie terrifying
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"Grave of the fireflies was the most painful here, two kids trying to survive in the aftermath of the war. Whats depressing here is that this might have happened to a lot of orphaned kids at those times and this could have still been going on up until now. Most powerful part is when the girl made a grave for the fireflies and the brother asking her why is she making them a grave and her telling his beother that she knew all along that their parents died and that the brother just cried his heart off because he kept on just being steong throughout the whole ordeal."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Strange how people are mentioning Bruno's death only from the movie Boy in the Striped Pyjamas when they shud be disturbed by everyone's death there including Schamuel
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"I just watched Grave of Fireflies a week ago. I’m not really an anime fan so I didn’t expect to like it and when I saw the brother die right at the beginning of the movie I was like “oh, well I already know how this ends so there goes any emotional impact it could have”. Man was I wrong. Best movie I’ll never watch again. Can’t even listen to the soundtrack without getting the feels."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,You know this list is f-ed up when Grave Of The Fireflies isn’t number one
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"While I agree with your picks, thank God, most of them I've never seen, I believe that ""The Elephant Man"" could be included to the list. I have watched the movie again and again, but I always skip over the parts where Merrick is taunted, beaten, and nearly killed. It's one of the most horrifying and sad movies I've ever seen."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,Grave of the fireflies is the most difficult movie to watch without busting with tears
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"Requiem for a Dream, for me, was the single most heart wrenching and depressing movies ever. I bought and still own, the director's cut. After loaning it out once and upon it's return, was told,  ""It made me want to slit my wrists watching it"".  I truly believe this is the essential anti-drug movie for everyone. All the films listed are depressing, but I agree with Requiem being #1."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,The boy in the striped pajamas is a must watch regardless of how sad it is
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"I cried multiple times during ""Grave of the Fireflies""- I saw in in theaters with my friends and I had never seen it before (It was Ghibli fest at my theater). I had to hold in gross sobs for the entirety of the movie."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"My mom watches the passion of the christ every easter, no matter how sad.Edit: I made this comment 3 months ago, I didn't expect it getting on top comments!"
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"I saw “The Boy in the Striped Pajamas” three times, the first time happened when I was in 8th grade after we read the book of the same name, the second was when I was in 10th grade when the substitute was there in history class, and the third time was when I was in 11th grade while we were working on the Holocaust in history. It was very sad and I cried."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"I recall watching The Boy in the Stripped Pajamas with my wife, she fell asleep with about 5 min left... I continued watching it. When she woke up she wanted to see the end, hoping for a good ending, saving her from the pain and frustration I knew would come )she loves stories with happy endings) I told her she did not want to watch it because of how sad it was..."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,I can only watch Schindler's List but once every few years. Its such a masterpiece.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"""Bruno wasn't supposed to die in there!""False. NONE of them was supposed to die in there"
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,For me the most depressing movie that I've ever watch and cannot watch again simply because it's too hard is Boys Don't Cry. It was too based on real events.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"I would also like to include ""Dancer in the Dark"" by Lars von Trier, starring Bjork (who was amazing in it). Such a painful movie I even had a hard time watching it through once, let alone twice!"
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"10. 0:40 Sand and fog 20039.   1:27 Grave of the fire flies 19888.2:23 Sophie's choice 19827.3:12 Million dollar baby 20046.4:09 The passion of the christ 20045.4:57 Precious 20094.5:50 Hotel Rwanda 20053.6:43 The boy in the striped Pyjamas 20082.7:29 Schinder's Iist 1993  8:20 Honourable Mentions (8:26 Life is beautiful  1997,8:33 Blue Valentine, 8:38 Boys dont cry 1999,1.8:54 Requiem for a dream 2000."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,‘Escape from Sobibor’ should definitely be an honourable mention. One of the most heartbreaking and distressing movies concerning the Holocaust that I’ve ever seen.
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"The Passion of the Christ, Requiem For A Dream, Schindlers List, and Grave of the Fireflies are movies I literally cannot watch ever again."
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"At the end of ""the boy in the striped pajamas"", i thought that they'd both escape, and live a happy life. I was shocked when i saw what actually happend"
sad movies recommend,QcA4qI9OZk8,"""TESTAMENT"", with Jane Alexander, is one of the best and depressing movies I've ever seen in my life. It is a look at the slow defeat that happens to the human race after nuclear weapons go off. It's both gritty and haunting. But it is incredibly depressing."

motivational movies recommend,3jWkxL0HfiQ,Rocky should have been #1. It has inspired me to push on even though there were great obstacles standing in my way. It is an instant classic and should have been moved to the top.

motivational movies recommend,3jWkxL0HfiQ,I cried like a newborn baby while watching 'The pursuit of Happyness' ... this is the most emotional and inspirational movie ever!!!
motivational movies recommend,3jWkxL0HfiQ,I understand why Whiplash didnt make the cut here but damn it was one very inspirational movie together with Shawshank Redemption. Both are masterpieces
motivational movies recommend,3jWkxL0HfiQ,I thought Rush (2013) was pretty motivational. How far the characters would go to reach their goal and how their rivalry pushed them to their limits.
motivational movies recommend,3jWkxL0HfiQ,"I would add ""Remember The Titans"", The Shawshank Redemption"", and ""We Are Marshall"".  I loved those movies."
motivational movies recommend,3jWkxL0HfiQ,"Amazing list, watchmojo had been dropping in the ideas department lately so its nice to see a decent list again, but considering Pay it Forward was number 1, they forgot about Kevin Spacey in American Beauty, my favourite and most inspiring film to me!"
motivational movies recommend,3jWkxL0HfiQ,agreed! 
motivational movies recommend,3jWkxL0HfiQ,Except there wasn't October sky on the list.
motivational movies recommend,3jWkxL0HfiQ, @TR Dumon  Yes!  I agree with you about October Sky needing to be here too.
motivational movies recommend,3jWkxL0HfiQ,It's a Wonderful Life will always be number one in my book. It always helps me remember I'm worth something in this world. That's inspirational above all else. 
motivational movies recommend,3jWkxL0HfiQ,"I can believe Rocky was only 10th. Its been the first movie to inspire me in a long time, to actually get healthy and start following my dreams and what I want to do. The sequels do the same thing (except 5, that was a big let down) and the saga ended perfectly with 6."

motivational movies recommend,3jWkxL0HfiQ,"La mejor película que he visto y la que más me ha inspirado es la de ""train night to Lisbon"" no es muy conocida pero se las recomiendo si son de mente abierta"
motivational movies recommend,3jWkxL0HfiQ,How can you forget The Shawshank Redemption?! It wasn't even in the honourable mentions! It is certainly more motivating than some of the movies you mentioned here. It belongs in the top along with movies like Its a Wonderful Life and The Pursuit of Happyness.
motivational movies recommend,3jWkxL0HfiQ,"I just saw Rocky again (only the second time that I've watched it). I forgot just how good the film is. It really did deserve Best Picture (which it won). It is a well-made, well-written and well-acted film that doesn't really have a happy ending."
motivational movies recommend,3jWkxL0HfiQ,"I remember watching pay it forward my freshman year of high school. It's my English teacher favorite movie. Then I saw it again in health class. I never took notes and most of the time, I read books in class. When we watched this movie we had to write an essay about it. My teacher know that I read a lot in class. He told me to write whatever and he will give a B. So I wrote about the movie like I was in that person's shoes. I learned a lot from the movie. I often recommend to friends when they need guidance "
motivational movies recommend,3jWkxL0HfiQ,"I had severe OCD(anxiety disorder) in my childhood to the age of 17. I watched a movie while having chicken pox and somehow it hit the sweet spot. It changed my life from shy, introvert, fat, victim, afraid to confident, extrovert, fit and brave. I still have anxiety but I have the power to cope with it.The name of the film is INCEPTION"
motivational movies recommend,3jWkxL0HfiQ,The Rocky movies are the most motivational films ever.
motivational movies recommend,3jWkxL0HfiQ,SO glad Dead Poets' Society was on there! One of my favorite movies ever. So inspiring.
motivational movies recommend,3jWkxL0HfiQ,I found The Shawshank redemption and The Dark Knight rises pretty motivational
motivational movies recommend,3jWkxL0HfiQ,Where is Soul Surfer? You missed that movie! It's really a motivational movie about a girl who lost her arm after a shark attack but still continues living her dream. That movie should also be #1!
motivational movies recommend,3jWkxL0HfiQ,"I loved the pursuit of happiness. The color purple and precious belong on the list too. Those women endured unspeakable abuse, but managed to go on build meaningful lives. "
motivational movies recommend,3jWkxL0HfiQ,They should also include October Sky in the list...... It's A must watch movie for everyone... :)
motivational movies recommend,3jWkxL0HfiQ,October Sky and The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty were two very motivational movies in my opinion.

motivational movies recommend,3jWkxL0HfiQ,Scarface actually motivates me a lot especially the push it to the limit scene.
motivational movies recommend,3jWkxL0HfiQ,"Very nice list! Almost every movie that should be here is! However, how the heck did Schindler's List and Shawshank Redemption not make it here?"

Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,"For me, I would add ""The Cell"" (2000) to this list. The film is usually looked-over, but its visuals and the storyline of trauma and sadism are brilliant as they are unnerving."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,THE CELL WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,"I would recommend ""One hour photo"" too"
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,"This list was probably limited to live action, but if we include animation, “Perfect Blue” should be on this list. Aronofsky lifted a lot of that movie’s imagery and used it in “Black Swan.”"
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,10. Gerald's game09. Fight club08. A history of violence07. Black swan06. Barton fink05. Under the skin04. American psycho03. Berberian sound studio02. Mulholland drive01. Memento

Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,Guys
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,Which one is ur fav gayuys?
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig, @ALL IS SHUBHA  black swan
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,"Memento made  me think of the Japanese series The Memorandum of Kyoko Okitegami which aired in 2015 but was based on the novel Okitegami Kyoko no Biboroku"" by Isin Nisio which came out the year before. One of my favorite shows.Good job on this one, Ashleigh!"
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,"This is a late comment, but ""old boy"" Is a good psychological horror, a lot of gore and a twist that you won't be able to guess on first watch. The movie will confused the hell out of you till the end, and I loved it!"
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,How could I have doubted that the master David Lynch would be on this list? Mulholland Drive is perhaps my favorite film ever. I find something new every time I watch. Highly recommend to any fan of psychological thrillers.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,"Mulholland Drive is my favourite movie of this genre, maybe my favourite in general as well. That is some genius directing, and when you actually interpret it, the movie gets you thinking about every detail of it"
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,"When Harry Met Sally is the most horrific psychological thriller of all time. Trying to understand the human heart, the utterly divergent subject of lust, and then to add in opposite sexes trying to figure each other out... and then smothering all that with “humor.” I still have nightmares about that deli scene."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,"I've read just about everything King's written, and only a few have scared me. Gerald's Game was one. I'm heavily nearsighted, and the idea that someone could be standing in the shadow and that I couldn't see them terrifies me."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,"There’s a movie called “Perfection” that I really enjoyed however I never see on any of these lists. If your bored and looking for a great psychological movie, check it out!"
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,Jacobs Ladder.Probably one of the absolute best psychological thrillers!
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,Yes no one mention this masterpiece ever.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,There’s a phenomenal Chinese one from 2004 called Koma. Basically about organ theft and a gigantic cat & mouse type thing.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,Fractured should be on here too
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,True
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,Yeah its amazing
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,Yes
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,yeah
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,It’s a copy of shutter island in some ways
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,"If you watched more than 5 movies in your life, u will predict whole movie in first 20 min, don't watch it"
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,Fractured was CRAZY!
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig, @L7ND0N  2007 or 2019 one? Google found two movies with this name
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig, @VIO  no 2007
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,Mehh
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,Primal Fear is one that plays with what you think you know
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,MUCH better Edward Norton movie than that other one.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,Ugghh I didn't like that movie
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,Looking at the comments... seems that this list needs a part 2!
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,Fight Club is a classic. Loved that movie.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,You do not talk about Fight Club.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig," @Vegan Rocker  - Yes, please do not waste anyone's time by talking about Fight Club."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,I consider some of these to be some of my favourite films of all time. I think that says something about me.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,We need to talk about why We Need To Talk About Kevin isn't on this list.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,underrated
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,kevin?
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,Yes! Excellent movie!
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,"Identity, Fracture, Vanilla Sky, A Beautiful Mind, Madhouse (2004) and Shutter Island (which seems to have drawn most of its content from Madhouse)."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,"Idk if it belongs on this list, but the movie ""Predestination"" starring Ethan Hawke really messed with my head."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,"It's pretty straightforward at the end. Mind blown yes but it doesn't mess u up. Unlike shutter island, whether it's real or not."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,"Gotta wonder how many people got the Futurama reference, and whether it was intentional."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,"""In Barton Fink, we get a different sort of Beast altogether""I see what you did there. Nice."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,"No Jacobs Ladder? and I never see anyone mention Brain Dead [1990] either, with Bill Paxton, and Bill Pullman. Great movie."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,I was hoping Fight Club would make it to this list. It's the first one that comes to mind when I hear the term Psychological Thriller. lol
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,A History Of Violence is a great movie i forgot about that one have not seen it in awhile but hey guy turns out to be a Badass the whole time and just takes all them guys out but damn i did not know it was based on a comic that is crazy and sweet
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,10:54 many would argue that beginning each new scene where the previous one ended is telling the story in chronological order. Telling the story backwards would be ending each scene where the previous one _started_.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,I can still remember how f-ed up in the head I felt after watching Black Swan.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,"The Devils Advocate(1997) starring Charlize Theron,Al Pacino, and Keanu Reeves was frightening"
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,"I would like to see The Voices mentioned on one of these lists.  Well it's a ""dark comedy"", it rides the line"
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,"You forgot to mention ""FRAILTY"", it's a Great mind bending movie!  It star's Bill Paxton and Matthew McConaughey.  Check it out, I think you'll love it.  Seriously......... Lol 🤟"
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,under the skin is one of my favorite indie films
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,Vertigo. The ultimate head trip.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,Fight Club is also loosely based on Edgar Alan Poe’s story “William Wilson”
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,DAMN! #2 and #1 are my favorite movies ever in that order
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,The Machinist was a good mind fck
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,You could have easily replaced Geralds Game with Lost Highway.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,Gerald's Game was crap & put me to sleep. Bug totally effed with me hardcore.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,Breaking Dawn with Kelly Overton was good too as well as Identity
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,Fight club such a good film and a brilliant sound track
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,C1C9OLNSPig,A friend of mine spotted the quick flashes of Brad Pitt on first viewing but still didn't predict the twist
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,"No, Shutter Island is NOT an honourable mention, it's top ten. It pulls you in every time you watch as if it's a first viewing. One of Leo's finest performances."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,"It's still my all-time favourite movie and whenever I hear on the nature of daylight, the whole movie starts playing in front of my eyes."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,"agree, i would put it on no 1"
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,My 2nd all time favorite movie after Fight Club!
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,It’s 1#
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Eh it was good but there are a couple better
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,"I haven't seen it yet, should I?"
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Shutter island is not on the list because it is the biggest waste of my precious time. In other words... Crap
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw, @YIJAPRA  you're to simple to enjoy it
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw, @YIJAPRA  I pity you. Anyone who understood it will love it. Period. My all time best. I fkn got chills for a min after watching it.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw," @YIJAPRA  I wld advise you to stay away from movies like inception, the invisible guest etc.."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Shutter Island was just bomb. It kept me awake all night reminiscing on it. I was scared to fall asleep in case I wake up in a mental hospital
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Same case in mr nobody
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Lol
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw, oh my god that's deadly. Maaaaaaaan I don't wanna go to shutter island.

Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw, @Ajka Khan  you're joking yeah?
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,"If u understand this, then it is a masterpiece. Underrated movie"
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw, @Playercc 124  indeed it's truly one of the most underrated movies
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,The book was way better. They did not do the book justice
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,It really is a good movie. Just finished watching it today ️
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Love that movie...just when u thought he was bout to get it...he still doesn't get it
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,We gotta find a way to get off this island Chuck
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,"I just finished watching Shutter Island because everyone in the comment section was talking about it and let me tell you something, it was FREAKING AWESOME!!!!!!!!!What a phenomenal film! I truly did not see that coming. It's in my top list now.Just watched Inception too, Man they are great. Some of Leo's bests."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Try side effects! You might enjoy it too if you don't know it yet
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,"You have a great taste, then. Glad you experienced it."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw, @More13Feen  But relatively low imdb. Is it worth watching?
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw," @Stealth  i thought it was tealy cool, IDK why it is not known on a eider basis. But then my taste is also a bit odd at times..."

Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,thanx
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,"Thank you, wish all MOJO lists had simple list. Rather than 14 mins of Spoiler Alerts"
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Shutter Island deserved number 1
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Benjamin X I agree. Shutter Island is a masterpiece.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Exactly!
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Have to disagree; Vertigo deserves its place as the top movie of all time to date (and that's also on the AFI top 100 list).
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,"Don't quite agree but it's among the best for sure, certainly better than the great but highly overrated Citizen Kane. Being a diehard Hitchcock fan, it's up there in my top 20 for sure."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,there is.no way shutter island is better than the silence of the lambs
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,a beautiful mind is better than that almost identical
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,the best movie
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,It is! That movie got me all fucked up! A masterpiece!
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Nope the book is better.But just a lil.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,"Shutter Island is just about the most average movie ever made, lucky even to get an honorable mention. Vertigo is #1 for very good reason. Just because you haven't seen it, doesn't mean it's not deserving of #1."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,I don’t know why but the butterfly effect is always overlooked as an amazing psychological thriller. Sure it has supernatural themes; but I think it adds to the overall macabre atmosphere of that film
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Yes...a very good film.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,It's entertaining but i'd hardly call it worthy as a top 10 ️ but then generally i don't like Ashton Kutcher as an actor!
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,"You watch shutter island once, you feel like like you understand the story then you keep thinking about it at night and watch it again and you feel more amazed that it's not what you think and you watch it again and again. Gosh, it's Leo's finest acting, the way his eyes portrayed what he felt. He should've won an Oscar."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,"I’ve just watched the show for the first time ever and can I just say, I’ve never felt this pumped up after a show. Leo’s performance was absolutely captivating and addictive. The storyline, the plot twists, and the way the show actually sucks you into the perspective of Leo’s character was fantastic. I’ll be rewatching it for sure.What a show man. Cinematic masterpiece "
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Momento is still one of my favorite movies ever. The acting is flawless. Everything is great. Same with the Silence of the Lambs.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,"Nice to see Vertigo coming in at No.1.  I saw the movie years ago and always felt there was something there but couldn't quite get a handle on it.  I did some research and read a few books, including Paul Hyder's insightful 'Hitchcock's Vertigo', and all the pieces of the puzzle came together.  I knew that I'd aced the movie when my Film Studies professor at university gave me an 'A'.  I was well chuffed."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Psychological thrillers are my favorite genre
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,me too but i only know inception and triangle are there any more good ones
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,FlyBoyZay FlyBoyZay you will love shutter island
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Watched that 20 million times forget about it tho
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,FlyBoyZay FlyBoyZay haha ok yeah great movie Just incase you haven’t seen these you probably have but The prestige is really good and Predestination is good as well
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Lmao i just watched the prestige yesterday on Netflix
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Thanks Gone Girl was pretty good but i felt Nightcrawler was a rip off of the usual suspects and everybody seen get out
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Spadidas same here.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,FlyBoyZay FlyBoyZay watch Predestination....your mind will be blown 
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Everyday's Entertainment mine did.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Everyday's Entertainment too bad the Spiegel brothers are going downhill now days.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Shutter Island should've made the list tbh. it was so good. had me confused and guessing even til the very end
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Wish I could watch that one without knowing the ending... someone accidentally spoiled it :(
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,SpaceZombie I feel the same with seven and fight club
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,"Chantal Renee Hayles  well, I still cant make up my mind what was the ""truth"""

Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Chantal Renee Hayles same I was perplexed
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,it's agood movie. not hard to predict for the veterans though.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,He crazy. Or maybe not?
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,"""A Tale of Two Sisters"" from South Korea is one of the most haunting films I've seen in my life.""Shutter"" from Thailand too (although more like a horror)"
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Can you recommend me some more ?
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,"Seven was a good movie, a lot of good actors, Spacey's character as the murderer was a classic,  Pitt and Freedman as the detectives complete the movie."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,"Mystic River and Jacobs Ladder! Two heartbreaking performances by Tim Robbins. He is such an incredible actor, so underrated."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,That is more of a murder mystery compared to a psychological thriller
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Shutter Island was the movie that really blowed my mind along with predestination.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,Wait hold up Shutter Island was an honorable mention? Fuck that
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,byXgz1gOjAw,"This is a great list, loved all the movies but I have to say Memento is my favorite only for the fact that it was so perfectly edited, to watch a movie backwards is a whole different experience."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,6NAc06aRXuQ,Some others I have found that were decent.The Voyeurs (2021)Mare of Easttown (2021)Wrath of Man (2021)Without Remorse (II) (2021)Nobody (I) (2021)Them (2021– ) Amazon TV SeriesThe Mauritanian (2021)Behind Her Eyes (2021)Servant by M.Night TV series

Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"""taxi driver'? i mean, it's one of my favorite films and part of the insane american film year of 1976, but i'd hardly describe it as a ""psychological thriller,'"" the problem being ""thriller."" rather, it's a slow burn with a minute or two of ""thriller"" climax. it's a cinematic masterpiece where you see scorsese trying out camera techniques that he'd perfect, and psychological? well yeah. but a thriller? i just don't buy it. same applies at a lesser technical level to ""donnie darko"" — again, great film, and loved it since i saw it in '04. One of those films where the soundtrack is essential to the film (that's a whole top 10 or 20 in itself), but every performance was spot-on, but a thriller it at no point — even its denouement."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,I would have preferred that The Prestige be on the actual list in the top five instead of just as an honorable mention as I have watched that movie hundreds of times and I’m still not sure which of the Borden twins is the one that survives and which dies. Also Inception should have made the list somewhere even if just as an honorable mentions.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"Mojo, I AM NOT  JOKING YOU ARE KIDDING' ME? PUBLICK MY SUBTITLES FOR THE SOCIAL NETWORK FACT V FICTION"
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,Idk if prison break counts. But I’d consider that show as well. Most elaborate writing I’ve seen in quite some time.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,Mulholland Drive <3 should be in 1 place
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,Joker or Seven but Silence of the Lambs is by far the most disturbing.

Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,That's cuz they're psychologically thrilling
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"It's because they are well done most of the time. Uhm if they not are well done, it become a comedy movie. You  can add the comedy genre on riddiculous overhyped action films as well."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,I agree
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"Imagine a Palpatine prequel presented as a psychological thriller, especially if they do not go near horror which is arguably less scary or impactful."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,Indeed my lord. Indeed.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,Facts
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,Definitely
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"They’re more impactful on people’s minds, and because they’re affected more they believe that the movie has fulfilled its purpose more so than other genres"
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,I feel like it has yet has only scatched the surface for what’s to come
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"""Shutter Island"" deserves so much more respect than it gets. The acting was gold and the plot twist? Mind blowing."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,Which would be worse: to live as a monster or die as a good man?
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"No, overrated"
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"Not the 1st movie to use that plot twist. I thought it was decent and I'd watch it again, but not mind blowing."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,The Prince of His Own Kingdom  well luckily it was the first one I saw with that plot twist so as long as its the first time you see that twist I guess it’s amazing
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,It is very good
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,Thought it was obvious tbh but a decent movie...one and done kinda movie 
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,I was surprised by the twist and this rarely happens!
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs, @BIRDBONES  live as a monster
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,P
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,T000
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,The psychological thriller is truly the best film genre!
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"I use to think comedy was for the shear fact that I can go back and laugh again as opposed to being surprised again by ""He was a ghost the whole time."" But as I think about it, my top 5 movies only contain 1 comedy so I guess that's false for me."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,Horror is a close second IMO
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,Film noir is the best
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"The Machinist is brutally underrated. Donnia Darko is too, because it's just too good. Gylenhaal's performance was legendary"
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,How is it underrated? Tons of people love the movie and it gets a lot of attention. Why do people call popular and famous things underrated these days as if they have no clue what the word means?
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"Oh btw im talking about the Machinist being underrated, were u referring to Donnie Darko?? cos in that case I admit my mistake, Donnie Darko is very popular and beloved, so u cant call it underrated. However, the Machinist IS underrated."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs," @safwan Alvi  Just typing the name into google brings up a 4.5/5 rating, a 77%positivity on RT, and a 7.7/10 at IMDB. The movie is literally highly rated. I think people need to go back to school and relearn words. I don't understand this new trend of purposely misusing words, unless people don't understand the literal meaning of the word they are using. What do you think underrated means?"
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"'Joker' is still one of my most favorite Hollywood movies.The first R-rated, non-DCEU film has officially made more than 1.065 billion globally.Won 2 Golden Globe awards and 2 Oscars including ""Best Actor-Drama.""Hollywood film legend Joaquin Phoenix did a great job playing Arthur Fleck/Joker."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,Loved the list. I particularly love Gone Girl. Rosamund Pike acting is just spell-binding.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"This list made me realize that ""psychological thriller"" is actually my favorite genre of movie."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"In an alternate universe , Christian Bale might be the Joker."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,The fact that he can fit in the profiles of every character of every genre till date makes him a LEGEND 
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,It reminds me of The Batman Who Laughs (Batman turned Joker)
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs," @Arkham Knight  or the white knight, where the Joker was Batman"
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,Joaquin Phoenix did an amazing job!!
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,“Fatal Attraction” (1987) definitely deserves to be on this list.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,Watchmojo: „The twist ending of shutter Island was a little predictable“Also watchmojo: puts shutter island on 9th place in „Movie reveals no one saw coming“lmao
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,The Night of the Hunter should have been mentioned. That movie is one of the creepiest movies one ever seen and Robert Mitchum was absolutely terrifying.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"Love all these movies.. but in my opinion the list was missing some exceptional psychological thrillers like Split, The Secret Window, and Hide and Seek."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,Secret window should definitely be on this list. Absolutely amazing movie
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,One of my favs.Johnny Depp's best work imo.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,That had a good twist!.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,Glad to see Nightcrawler on this list. That movie is a must watch!
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,“Mother!” Is also a very great one and was very messed up but had a core message and it had Jennifer Lawrence in it that acted beautifully
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"Psychological thrillers is a great subgenre, they make you think and twist your mind!"
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,So what would the genre be?
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs, @larua4  thriller?
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,Shutter Island is way too low in the list.20th???Seriously???It's one of those psychological thriller masterpieces who needs multiple viewings to be truly loved.

Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"Does anyone else remember 1997’s “The Game” with Michael Douglas and Sean Penn??? To this day, it’s been the only movie that’s made me want to beat the shit out of the TV upon viewing the climax at the end. SOOO good!"
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,The Game is an amazing film
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,Arlington Road tho!!! Nobody even mentioned that

Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"Ive never heard of it, im gonna watch it! Im looking for good movies of this kind to watch while im in quarantine "
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,a lot of people didn’t enjoy it but my favorite psychological thriller is “The Perfection” i could watch it a thousand times and be just as surprised every one
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,I’m so glad The Machinist was listed.  One hell of a movie!
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"I feel as though Jake Gyllenhaal doesn’t get as much credit as he deserves; not saying people don’t know him, but this list shows he can do whatever genre of film"
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,I would definitely add the original Sleuth to this list; I'd put it in the top five.Honorable mention to Kenneth Branagh's Dead Again.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"Could you count Inception? Cause that's my favorite film of all time. Blend of heist, sci fi, action, and I may say thriller"
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,Denis Villeneuve's 'Prisoners' and 'Enemy' deserve a place in this list
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,I actually cried at the end of Joker
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,just what i need after a tough practice  a top 20 is always a good remedy
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"Perfect Blue is my favorite of the genre, though I agree with a lot on these on the list."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,I'm about to watch both 'Vertigo' and 'The Silence of the Lambs' in the future. Natalie Portman did a great job and she deserved an Oscar. Martin Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' was both intense and impressive indeed.
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"Orphan 2009 also deserve's a place, atleast an honorable mention."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"There are a lot and I mean a lot of Psychological Thrillers missing from this list, such as  'The Game', 'Stalker', 'I Saw the Devil', 'Primal Fear', 'A Pure Formality', 'The Invisible Guest', 'Inception' etc..."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"One you may have overlooked.  ""Raising Cain"", with John Lithgow."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"Fun fact: the quote used in American Psycho where he says “you know what Ed Gein said...when I see a woman, part of me wants to take her out and treat her real nice, and the other part wonders what her heard would look like on a stick,” this quote is incorrectly attributed to the serial killer Ed Gein, but it was actually said by a different serial killer named Ed, Ed Kempur (who is portrayed in the Netflix series Mindhunter)"
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"Agree with #20, 15, 14, 10,9, 7, 5 and 3Not on the list..... The Prestige, Sunshine, American Psycho, Falling Down, 12 Monkeys, Copycat, The Cell, Hard Candy, Fraility, Zodiac, The Bone Collector and In The Cut."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"You know, I love the scene where Anthony Hopkins says that line, but I will never be able to get over how he says Chianti."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,Se7en is a MUST watch
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"Seven has one of the best plot twists ever though it feels people speak little of it as time goes by, sadly."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"I’ve seen all these movies. All of them, horrible, horrible stories... and I LOVE each one of them! One Hour Photo is also good. And maybe Misery should have been ON the actual list."
Psychological thrillers movie recommend,J6xaF9H0OEs,"Should have had A Cure For Wellness, brilliant film."
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,How does Killer Klowns from Outer Space not get an honorable mention at least?
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,+kieralinn It's because it's the best arthouse drama I've seen so far! ;D
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,+DarthDubby So deep and metaphorical. By far the best film about drug addiction I've ever seen.
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,+kieralinn It was always made to be a horror comedy. It was paying homage to cheesy B films. All of these are unintentional.
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,+kieralinn Yeah that and Maximum Overdrive
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,I agree
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,+kieralinn because it sucks
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,+kieralinn Or the Tremors franchise?
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,+kieralinn Because they don't like the same movies as you... oh yeah I went there
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,agreed its so bad its good...that and Troll 2
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,+kieralinn or what about C.H.U.D (Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers)?
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,"I would've Put ""Night of the Living Dead"" at #1, since it pretty much inspired an entire genre."
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,Kind of feel like that's a B movie that turned out to be an A!
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,"Right?? I had ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" #1. With NOTLD at #2."
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,NotLD was what created the zombie craze.  after that movies like Zombi 2.   show like walking dead.  and games like resident evil.   all born from Night of the Living Dead..  simply because of the influence it has on todays culture.. around the world even.
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A," @Yog-Sothoth  it also had an awesome ending.  I think dawn of the dead followed suit with a pretty cool ending, too."
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,"Yep. Prior to that, zombie movies were all about voodoo and religious garbage like that. NotLD showed how there were other, and better, ways to make zombies. That inspired comets, aliens, and the most common reason for zombies, the zombie virus. It was one of the first movies to not have a happy ending. One where the 'hero' gets killed off."
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,"I agree, Btw, Plan 9? Terrible movie if you’re into that. lol"
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,"Carnival of Souls deserves a place on the list. I expected that to be included. It's an impressive, memorable, teeny budget thriller with style and a truly eerie vibe."
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,Also one of the few films that ages amazingly when compared to any other.
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,Oh that's a creepy classic
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,"I've acted in local theater alongside David Miller, the lead in Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. He's a very good actor, not to mention a great guy."
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,"You know, the first 'Mad Max' film is actually a B-Movie as well. Low budget, made on the fly with Guerilla filmmaking tactics that mad a huge amount of money and created careers for its director and lead actor. Its just made so well, that people forget how cheap it actually is as a film."
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A," @omerta0414  Yeah, ha ha, I just realize I fucked up. I'll fix that."
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,ON the fly
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,+gutz1981 Yep! It wasn't a major Movie Theater Release when it came out either.
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,"I hated that movie, never made it to even the half of it—that's why when the second one (is it a sequel? Or a remake?) was out I couldn't care less."
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,"+gutz1981  Actually, in the context that you used it, ""Guerilla"" is the proper word. Or did you fix it before I saw it? (lol)"
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,Same with Drunken Master (1978).
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,George Miller paid the semi-truck driver a couple bottles of beer (maybe case) to do the job.
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,gutz1981 you my sir know your stuff
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,"HOW THE FUCK DOES NO ONE KNOW ""B MOVIE"" means a movie not in cinemas"
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,"That is not what it means at all, it comes from double features where the ""B Movie"" played after the main feature."
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,"My favorite is ""Night of the Comet"".  That would have been a great one to add to the list."
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,"A few of my favorite B-Rated movies were: Night of the Creeps (1986), The Stuff (1985), House (1985), & Terror Vision (1986)."
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,"""[The Evil Dead] singlehandedly launched the careers of director Sam Raimi and lead actor Bruce Campbell.""There was also a certain assistant editor to the main editor (Edna Paul) whose name was Joel Coen. I heard he and his younger brother may have had a successful career in the film industry."
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,"+BlueFox94 yes, but that movie didn't launch his career"
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A, @Alex Arvin  True. But Joel's experience with the film did give him and his brother Ethan the confidence to make Blood Simple and the rest is history.
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,Awesome I didn't know that evil dead is one of my favorite movies..I think the special fx people went on to do other good stuff as well.
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,+BlueFox94 just possibly  !?  we''ll have to WIKI that one!!
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,BlueFox94 I had no clue! That's cool info. You're a movie genius. Got any recommendations for obscure cult or b movie flicks?
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,My mother used to work at a drive inn theatre when I was a kid of 9 years old when the original night of the living dead came out. I was put in the car to watch the movie while my mom was in the ticket booth. Traumatised does not even begin to describe how it effected me. If I see commercials for the walking dead I’m having nightmares all night and I watched that movie 50 years ago!
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,"LOVE THIS LIST. I grew up watching the Blob, Night of the Living Dead, and Dead Alive! Great!"
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,"Mad Max was a B-Movie, so were Desperado (El Mariachi) and Iron Sky. All of which were made on a very very very low budget. But, they were impressive. Not to mention the multitude of B SciFi Movies of the 50's and 60's that are not on this list."
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,How about a list about some of the more recent B-movies? I saw a great one called The Dark Side of the Womb that was really pretty amazing.
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,The 1980s version of the blob is pretty terrifying.
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,And much better.
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,Theyre about to Remake it again
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,Terrifying ?? Haha it is cheesy and funny perfect to get drunk to and laugh
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,Gadiel Gonzalez  it a bad movie at all.
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,The greatest B-Movie ever is 'Assault on Precinct 13'. No doubt about it.No one did better low budget thrillers than John Carpenter at his best.
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,"Music for that as well was superb, being re sampled for a hip hop track and winding its way into Xenon 2 game I would rank this as number 2 and Night of the living dead as number 1."
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,Braindead is a FREAKIN' CLASSIC !!!Gonna re-watch it right now.
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,"i`m surprised ""dawn of the dead""  didn`t get a mention,  it surely qualified as a B - type flick.   my favorite by far of all the ""dead"" movies."
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,"Killer Klowns From Outer Space was, in my opinion, the best of the B-movies."
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,"I love The Blob, Night of the Living Dead--the originals, of course. And Attack of the Monster Crabs and Plan 9 From Outer Space."
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,"‘Machete’ satires B movies and can’t be on the list, but ‘Attack of the Killer Tomatoes’ is a satire of B movies and took the #1 spot?  "
b-movie recommend,KwQofwibM-A,"I sincerely believe that Night of The Living Dead is one of the finest movies of all time, it plays well into it's low budget making it seem more real, especially for the time."

b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,"I LOVE this movie. It is a childhood favorite of mine, although it helped my fear of clowns (more hatred than fear now, at 38-years old. I’ll warn a clown, and tell them to stay a minimum of 6 feet away from me. They get too close, I will not HESITATE to knock their block off. I DO warn them!). I was 6-years old, when it was originally released. I was probably 8, when I saw it. It hit HBO, I came across it, and couldn’t turn my eyes away. I was GLUED! I ended up watching it about 14 times, in one weekend. Everytim it came on HBO that weekend, I was ON it...and this was back when there was only ONE HBO channel (aside from East & West being split due to time zones)"
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,It's currently on Netflix.
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,"was killer klowns not supposed to be a comedy to begin with? most of the movies on this list are either supposed to be serious or fail at being a different kind of comedy,  but killer klowns seems like it’s supposed to be a genre parody ala attack of the killer tomatoes."
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,I would’ve thought it would’ve been at least top 10 but To have it at 20 is ridiculous
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,American Werewolf in London is also really great. Blends horror and comedy beautifully plus it has some of the absolute best practical effects
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,"Night of the Living Dead, The Evil Dead, Mad Max, The Room, & John Carpenter’s The Thing are not only great B Movies but are classics. Especially considering each movies legacy and overall effect it had on the film industry."

b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,Best Killer Tomatoes movie ever!!!
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,"""Tomayto!!!"" "
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,I love b movies and this list is good and to have Plan 9 on the list is amazing I love this movie cause it was made with passion of filmmaking
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,"B-Movies can be incredible when you dont set your expectations up too high, never know what you might find, i myself love Evil Dead, They Live and Killer Klowns From Outer Space."
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,Oh My God! I knew BrainDead/Dead-Alive would be on This List!It’s one of My Favorite Horror Movies of All Time!️️
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,Peter Jackson's other cult early movies Bad Taste and Meet The Feebles are worth a watch too
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,Same
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,I don’t know why I thought that the BEE MOVIE would come out here
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,"I know these lists tend toward the mainstream (cult or no), so I wasn’t surprised by the omission of 1949’s The Window. This is one of the best movies out there, despite being produced by a b studio. The Boy Who Cried Wolf meets Rear Window with very impressive effectiveness. Give this one a watch."
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,Night of the comet was awesome in my opinion it was a great B movie.
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,"The Blair Witch Project freaked me out, even though I knew it was just a mockumentary.  One of the most original ideas for a horror film ever.Night of the Living Dead was great too, but Return of the Living Dead was even better."
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,"Killer Klowns from Outer Space, and, The Stuff are two of the most underrated movies of all time in my personal opinion."
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,"For those that like the movie, The Stuff, i just found it free to watch on, tubi."
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,Great list ! I just wished “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” was there.
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,"Finally Killer Klowns from Outer Space gets some credit! Also I heard they made a sequel but it was either canceled or it was just a straight-to-home movie, is this true?"
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,Killer Klowns from Outer Space was  one of my favorite movies growing up. So many people don't know what it is though when I talk about it. My sister and I watched it all of the time.
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,I was totally surprise by the Night of the Living Dead at number one. I thought # 1 would be Halloween or Friday the 13th.
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,"I see Killer Klowns, I clicked right away"
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,"I love killer clowns from outer space. My guilty pleasure movie, I know it is not the best evil clown movie, but the sight of a shadow t rex eating people is amusing as hell."
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,"Evil dead and the thing are very impressive indeed, but I disagree that they are B movies"
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,I loved killer klowns from outer space. I even bought the VHS as a teen.
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,I love how half of these are legitimately great movies that are intentionally goofy. The other half are so-bad-they’re-good schlock.
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,Eight Legged Freaks wasn't on the list but is my favorite B rated movie and was one Scarlett Johansson's first movies!
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,The sound of the piranha attacking is the scariest part of the movie.
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,"Does this include the ""Bee Movie"" or is that on a different spectrum"
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,"I remember being 5 and making out with my Jill Doll in the closet while watching Killer Klowns From Outer Space, so I hold a fondness for it. I even remember it was a scene where a clown waved at a girl at a fast food place. I've seen The Rocky Horror Picture Show over 120 times, saying I love it would be an understatement. I love the 80s Blob movie more than the McQueen version. Carnival of Souls, Pink Flamingos (any John Waters), Foxy Brown, The Room, Brain Dead, The Thing, Evil Dead, and Night of the Living Dead are all classics which I enjoy greatly and I frequently rewatch them"
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,B-movies are amazing i love watching them all i ever watch are older movies so much more interesting i have seen most of these and i love brain dead so much! i love zombies and gore and rita is always my favourite character even though shes not the main actress
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,"The Naked Lunch, Repoman, Earth girls are easy, Street Trash, The Return of the Living Dead"
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,Hard to pick between Killer Klowns and Evil Dead. Two great B movies I have ever seen in my life
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,I absolutely loved Killer Klowns from Outer Space I might be corny but I like that movie!
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,"""Number 1. Bee Movie. Sorry, couldn't resist."" You guys actually got me with that one. "
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,I thought “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” was excellent.  It’s one of my favourites.  I didn’t know it was a B- movie.
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,"The disaster artist as base on a book Greg Sestero wrote  ""The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made"""
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,I can proudly say I have every movie on this list in my collection
b-movie recommend,fGGSzmE7CKo,Killer Clowns should be higher on the list
