funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,We need more people like you in the world.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,The heroe we dont need but the horoe we deserve
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,I can’t believe hot fuzz isn’t here that is a great movie!
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"I don't want to live in a world where What We Do In The Shadows is at place 20, and Hungover is even on the list."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Thank you so much
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,thanks man
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8, @It’s Chris  it’s mentioned during Shaun Of The Dead
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Dodgeball is one of the most underrated comedy movies. Definitely should have at least been an honorable mention.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,I agree
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,old school is not on here as well
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Blade, Lazer.............Blazer"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Yeah they should have dropped Wet Hot American Summer for Dodgeball IMO.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Sam thing with austin powers
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Old school, meet the parents are missing"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Agreed
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8, @Ehouse33  travesty that movie was hilarious. Will Ferrell was hilarious. Every time I hear Dust in the Wind I think of Old School.  You're my boy Blue
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Definitely agree along with Anchorman.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,My favorite movie of all time
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"""The Other Guys"" is seriously underrated. That movie deserves at least an honorable mention! AT LEAST!"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,I am a peacock you gotta let me fly !!
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Got to have little river band on
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Other guys isn’t underrated. Ok it wasn’t on the list that doesn’t mean underrated.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Products of cheap high industrial pickup ornamental
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Boring movie
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,True
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,it should be second or third imo
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Looks like Scarface sneezed on your car
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Bye Shiela
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,I love The Nice Guys. Have watched it twice. The chemistry of all characters is flawless in the movie. This really strange yet comedic movie deserved the honorable mention.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,We needed this during this time. Talladega Nights should have been top 15 but to not even get an honorable mention is questionable at best.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Nico Cusimano eh. It’s funny but not as good as step brothers or anchorman
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Mine is Office Space, since I can 90% relate to that. Relating to a movie and bringing it to comedy makes it my#1."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Tropic Thunder is the movie that solidified RDJ as one of the greatest actors of all time for me
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Seriously
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Watch more movies
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Being an Indian even I approve the fact!!
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Stannis The Mannis as a person who’s movie range spans from The Godfather to Halloween to Rocky, I’m pretty sure I’m well rounded. But thanks for your opinion on my life"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Kahlil Pittman so you really think he’s anywhere near Brando, Day Lewis, Olivier, De Niro, Pacino etc?"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Lmao! Not even close. Rdj is a average actor.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Stannis The Mannis have you not seen any of his earlier movies?
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Kahlil Pittman yes and he’s fine but no where near being an all time great. He can’t even touch the best of today (DiCaprio and Phoenix)
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Stannis The Mannis explain why you don’t think he’s great
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Kahlil Pittman doesn’t have the range, screen presence, natural ability that can’t be taught, can’t carry an average/mediocre film etc"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,This Is The End is a cultural masterpiece. I can watch it over and over. Love Jay Baruchel but the one that makes this movie great is Danny McBride.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,I’m definitely going with This Is The End. I don’t think any movie has made me laugh harder. The Nice Guys is close though too.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Bruh This Is The End is fucking hilarious 
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"I agree, this is the end is the holy grail of comedy film"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,It was the last great comedy movie of that time. Other than 22 Jump Street.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,I agree and borat for me
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Notable omissions: Talladega Nights, Wedding Crashers, Old School, Life Aquatic, and Scott Pilgrim. Also, I would have put Hot Fuzz in over Shaun (I actually find SotD to be the weakest of the Cornetto Trilogy, though still damn great!)"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,I prefer Hot Fuzz as well
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8," @106andie  Hot Fuzz gives me a headache, Shaun of the Dead all day every day"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"We're The Millers, 2013 is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, it should be on the list.  I haven't met anyone who has seen it who hasn't thought it was one of the best comedies they have ever seen.  It is an overlooked movie."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Agreed haven't laughed that much since office space
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"One of the last comedy movies that had a pair and studios still didn't care about triggering 10 snowflake liberals on Twitter, but it changed probably around 2015."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Never has a movie made me laugh as much as Borat. It is in my opinion the best comedy movie ever.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"I agree, BORAT 1 and BORAT 2 are so good"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Thanks guys....we needed this list to binge watch in these times
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,You know that.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Preach
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,John C. Reilly was comic gold in the 2000s. Happy to see they put Walk Hard on this list
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"I loved LITERALLY everything about this list... but I feel that instead of School of Rock, Nacho Libre would've been better. I'm the biggest fan of Jack Black and I cannot tell you how much of a cult classic Nacho Libre has on the youth and even the adult side. But this list? Way to go Watch Mojo... you too Rebecca from watch mojo"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,the wolf of wall street is not categorized as a comedy but  its funny as hell
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Drama/Comedy
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"I love #17, #11, Zombieland, and #1. But I’m a little surprised We’re The Millers didn’t make the list."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Pretty good list, but Super Troopers should be #1 and Role Models needs to be top 10."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Who is here because they don’t know what else to watch for quarantine?
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Me
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Meeeee!
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Me
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Dude...

funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Everyone
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Syaufi Shaharuddin me I saw every movie you can think of I’m really bored
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Well the search was what is best movie in Netflix
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Watch the Gentlemen movie it's amazing
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Syaufi Shaharuddin yup lol

funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"As with just about every one of these Mojo lists that I've watched on YT, this one is maddening for some of its inclusions, exclusions, and rankings.  And, also keeping up tradition, what makes this list particularly irritating for me is that it DOES include a good number of my favorite comedies of that time block, which gives it credibility I can't easily repudiate; YET, I almost feel ashamed for agreeing with a good number of their choices, so annoyed am I with the aforementioned issues I have with it.  Ok, I must pick a bone here that I find wildly off the mark - the inclusion of the WILDLY overrated (by some) Napoleon Dynamite, and the complete shut out/oversight of the similarly oddball/eccentric Hot Rod, which I would absolutely rank among my 20 favorite comedies of ALL TIME.  Sorry, but I will always see ND as a movie that was swept up in a wave of hype that I still find difficult to comprehend, to this day.  The pacing was soooo leaden, and the characters were all one dimensional, anthropomorphized quirks, rather than believable human beings.  It is an odd movie, to say the least.  It just isn't genuinely funny.  Hot Rod, on the other hand, is hysterical.  It's one of a relatively small group of comedies which contain one or more scenes that had me literally gasping for oxygen, so hard was I laughing.  Sure, the motivations and actions could be seen as possessing an off-kilter, almost surreal eccentricity which in a sense can be seen as similar to that of ND, but the similarity ends there.  Hot Rod benefits hugely from its brilliant cast, filled with hilarious actors and comic conceptualists like Andy Samberg, Bill Hader, Will Arnette, and Danny McBride.  Damn, I've gone on waaay too long already.  If you haven't seen Hot Rod, just do it.  Watch it at least two or three times, just so you make sure you give it a chance, when you are in the right mood.  On first viewing, I liked it, but the second time was a revelation, for some reason.Oh, great work, Mojo people, choosing Tropic Thunder, a real contender for my all time favorite comedy, but then you went and fumbled it on the  five yard line by slating it at number eleven!  Way too low!  That movie is a layered, brilliant, amazingly hilarious work of cinematic art!  Robert Downey, Jr. gave a performance for the ages in what would have been a massively demanding role; everyone involved (yes, Tom Cruise and Matthew McConaughey both do hilarious work) did great, stunningly funny work.  Oh, and I can barely praise Justin Theroux and Ben Stiller enough for one of the smartest, funniest, and most inventive screenplays I've ever encountered.  Damn, I love that movie!Beyond that, I think Anchorman was a laudable number one pick - it's certainly in my top three, at least - and I strongly agree about Zoolander, Shaun of the Dead, and 40 Year Old Virgin, as well.  Really, I would have made room for Talladega Nights and Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, but it was a good list, overall.  Oh, hold on - Wedding Crashers was fantastic!  Where was that?  Must give this more thought... I'll let myself out.  Bye, now.  (Minutes later): I hadn't looked at other comments before I posted, and now that I have, I just want to add my vote for The Other Guys, which is incredible on a number of levels, too.  That's one hilarious movie, and Wahlberg was SO great!  I loved that he was not the straight man, really; he was the really the super pissed off man, and was so funny delivering his uncontained rage that he actually came off as even funnier than Ferrell, though it was close.  ""I'm a peacock - you gotta let me fly!""  Awesome movie!!!"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Idk
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"There are most certainly two that belong on this list far more than stoner films:  Dale and Tucker vs. Evil, and Rat Race."

funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Great list, also loved Carell’s, The Incredible Burt Wonderstone."

funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8," @Jeshurun.144k  Sounds like weed isn't your problem bro.  Weed is literally medicine to millions.  You got darker demons than weed, and no magic sky sorcerer is going to fix that.  Just get a therapist.  Same thing."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Missing: We’re the Millers, Horrible Bosses, Wedding Crushers, Meet the Parents, Harrold and Kumar, Dodgeball."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,It’s a top 20... movies are gonna be left out
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Honorable Mention Gosling with Russell?
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8, @Zuzu  The Royal Tennenbaums was a BORING ASS movie.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,NorbsWS horrible bosses shouldve been top 5
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Harold and Kumar is legendary
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8, @Tiana Pi Tesr  the nice guys
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,NorbsWS if you can dodge a wrench...
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Of those listed, while many are funny movies, only Harold & Kumar is good enough to be a top 20."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,NO! THAT'S JUST WRONG. I don't even want to finish the list now 
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Anchorman Probably my favorite movie of all time. I was expecting it to be at like the 15-10 slot though. Then I started watching and it hadn’t showed up. By #2 I was like “fine ok it’ll get an honorable mention”. Then I saw it at 1. I flipped out
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Love that Mean Girls is on the list, but Date Night (with Tina Fey and Steve Carrell) is another great movie."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Four Lions is one of the most underrated comedy movies. If you think The Dictator is great, you’ve not seen Four Lions"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,I've seen 5 movies on this list and only liked 3 of them. I love Napoleon Dynamite. That's one of the best movies ever.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Overall good list. A few I’m not a huge fan of personally. I would have liked to have seen Dodgeball on this list as well though.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Leaving out Wedding Crashers is unforgivable
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,...... I'm watching the list.... now.. .... are you fucking...KIDDING ME.....
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8, @Flipo  1999 bro
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8, @christopher Mennell  you mean 2005.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"No doubt in my mind that modern classics like Borat, Step Brothers & Anchorman would be on the list but to put Zoolander at such a low spot as #10 is a minor travesty. However it's nice to see movies like Budapest Hotel & Shaun of The Dead on the list, really loved the style of Budapest and Shaun is a classic that you can watch a couple of times a year without getting tired of it."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,The Nice Guys (2016) totally killed me.. couldn't stop laughing. Didn't know how funny Ryan Gosling was
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,The Johnny English series is damn hilarious....
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Way to good to be mentioned in this list
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Dude I Just Finished (5 mins ago) Watching The Last Part of Johnny English and This Is The Reason Why I'm Here 
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Everyone's sleeping heavily on the scary movie franchise they were fucking legendary
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,This is probably the first time i agreed with the number 1 Side note this got to be the craziest movie to be made when it started with them being stranded on a mountain fighting monkeys that throw ninja stars 
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Wedding Crashers should have been on the list. Super Troopers should have had more than an honorable mention. Did I miss Horrible Bosses?
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Harold and Kumar and a Grandma’s Boy should definitely be on this list!
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,I agree and also paul
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"People will always have different opinions on humor/comedy, that's just how it will always be. On this list, there are some that I agree with, don't agree with, and I would've changed the rankings of some as well. I'm glad Super Troopers was honorably mentioned, but it should have been on the actual list. Movies (Since 2000) that I feel should have either been on the list or at the very least honorably mentioned are (in no particular order):Old SchoolWedding CrashersThe Other GuysDodgeballYour HighnessForgetting Sarah MarshallHorrible BossesGrandma's BoyMeet the ParentsHonestly, there needs to be a Top 50 list since there are so many great comedies."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,I feel that Wedding Crashers should've at least been in the honorable mentions don't ya think?
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,How does Austin Powers NOT make the top 20?!! Y’all had 3 movies to pick from. That trilogy was a cultural phenomenon! Bad Santa and Dodgeball are glaring omissions as well; riotously funny stuff.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Old Skool, How High and Harold and Kumar are in my personal top 10. With ""Who made the Potatoe Salad?"", and ""Step Brothers"" tied as my 1#."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"How did you leave off the list some of the truly best movies of the century, comedy or otherwise?4) How High3) The Harold and Kumar films2) Clerks 21) Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back and Jay & Silent Bob Reboot"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,It's nice to see Popstar mentioned even if it was an honorable mention.  I would have swapped Zoolander out for Dodgeball though. Stepbrothers gets my top spot
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"In my opinion, ""Gun Shy"" would have to beat out 75% of the list.  I know it came out in 2000, but too many people consider that the first year of this century.  Too many of the others took me back to my much-hated middle school days."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Funny not a single Kevin Hart, Adam Sandler, or Jim Carrey film on the list lol"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Glad to see it was on the honorable mentions but The Nice Guys should of definitely made the main list that movie had me in stitches
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,A Million Ways to Die in the West (2014)  is one of the greatest comedy on my opinion
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"How is this list so drastically different than the recent ""Top 10 comedies of the 2010s and 2000s""?"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Dodgeball is one of the best comedies of all time. Criminally underrated
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"I actually called the top three, with Anchorman as 1.  As proud as I feel, I am humbled about Ross Tanenbaum below me.  He is so right."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"One of my favorites is ""Eurotrip."" Maybe it is a guilty pleasure movie, but I just love every part of it. Plus, we got ""Scotty Doesn't Know"" which is just a fun song."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"My favorite comedy of the last 20 years is legally blonde, I know it’s crazy girlish and the humor maybe too simple and cute but It made laugh out loud so much."
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"There’s just so many great comedies you have to leave some off. Dodgeball, Wedding Crashers, Role Models, Harold & Kumar franchise, Horrible Bosses, Hot Tub Time Machine. I know even I’m missing a bunch"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,Can't find anymore comedy films like these today. Those were the best years for comedy movies.
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Salute to all the Paul Rudd on this list, including the awesome Brian Fantana at #1! "
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"I'm surprised ""Bad Words"" wasn't in the list. That movie is amazing!"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,"Another comedy that flies under the radar is Down With Love, starring Rene Zellweger and Ewan McGregor"
funny movies recommend,s0gdBeTqql8,MXC deserves to be a entry it took a old Japanese game show and turned it into a cult classic still love it
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Which comedy pleasantly surprised you the most?
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"Sausage Party. It was ridiculously inappropriate, but way funnier than I thought it would be."
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,2 days ago
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Due Date is an underrated classic
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Paddington
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Me 21 and 22 jump street
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,White chicks definitely white chicks. The wayans brothers haven't exactly made a whole bunch of movies that i've enjoyed but i was so surprised at how funny and enjoyable white chicks was. I'm writing this as i paused the video during the honourable mentions. Let's see what's number 1.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Also easy a love that one. I thought it was going to be very formulaic it was not. And the parents were super hillarious.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Midnight express
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Zombieland. I love the movie so much!!!!
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Hitman's Bodyguard. I definitely wasn't prepared for how funny that movie was.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Great list. I was well and truly surprised by 21 jump street when I first saw it. I was laughing so hard watching it.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"Game Night is one of the best comedies released in the 2010s.  The cast's chemistry is great, and the jokes hold up to multiple viewings."
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"As always, awesome list! At first I was thinking to myself, ""self, I can't even think of ten movies that exceeded my expectations."" However, you guys are all very good at what you do and hit 10 nails directly on the head! I'm even willing  to bet that you can make more lists with the same subject. Keep up the good work!"
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,So no one's talking about how super bad isn't on the list
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Was thinking it was gonna be number one:(
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Wow cant believe that wasnt on the list. It's an instant classic.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,I thought it was overrated and pretty tone deaf
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,I feel like that one was expected to be good
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,List is unexpected funny movies. Superbad was advertised as comedy but definitely surpassed any expectations
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Brynden Rivers lol how is it tone deaf? It’s like the exact opposite of tone deaf. It’s by far the most realistic depiction of what high school is actually like.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"It was after 40 year old virgin, it's made by same folks, so expection was high"
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,I know right that movie is funny as shit
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,One of the best comedies
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"It’s because everyone knew it was going to be good. After the success of The 40-year Old Virgin, everyone knew Judd Apatow’s next movie was gonna be awesome"
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"To me, the 40 year old virgin will always be the perfect type of comedy because it tells such a strong and touching story that also has hilarious jokes which aren’t meant to be superior to the narrative"
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,I’ve never laughed harder than the first time I saw 21 jump street. I tricked my dad into taking me because he didn’t know it was rated R and as a 12 year old it was awesome. That will truly go down as a classic.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"Walk Hard is amazing. The comedy, the freaking music is 100% amazing, and nearly every scene perfectly displays the years through which Dewey's life runs through."

funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,We need a part 2 now! Loved this list.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,I was really impressed by Game Night. My husband and I were surprised at how well it turned out.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Im happy to see Game Night get recognition! Absolutely hilarious ride!
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Loved it!
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"I'm surprised Mean Girls wasn't at least in the top 3, there are countless meme pages that quote the movie and a lot of people still use Tina Fey's iconic lines from the film in real life. Not to mention it was such a hit that it got a spot on Broadway"
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Not funny
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,There are countless meme pages that quote Will Ferrel movies. Even tho they are not funny.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,We are the Millers had me and the wife rolling. Never expected it to be as funny as it was. Bridesmaids was piss yourself funny too.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,I remember laughing a lot during We are the Millers!  I'll have to watch it again!
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,what? it sucks
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"for me, ""parent trap"" is the best comedy movie ever because it has a really good storyline or plot, and i still couldn't find a comedy movie better than parent trap until today"
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"Gotta say, Popstar Never Stop Never Stopping should at least be an honorable mention, and Election (1999) should be pretty high because of how it completely subvrts expectations. But Napoleon Dynamite is a fitting number one."
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"Jumanji 2017 had me crackin' up hardcore! Jack Black was a nice surprize and each actor did an AMAZING job playing each character! I really wasn't expecting much after standing at Redbox for 5 minutes looking for one of the few movies I hadn't seen and finally settled with this! Jumanji (2019) was pretty darn funny, too!"
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,21 Jump Street for me. I didn’t think it would be that good. Ended up being one of my favorite comedies. Can just throw it on Netflix and watch it without thinking it’s a waste
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"Hot tub time machine had absolutely no reason to be as good as it was, yet there we are"
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,It’s SO STUPID XC watched it like 8 times

funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,👍 agreed
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,It was alright
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"Especially 40 Old Virgin. It was a surprisely warm, funny, funny and great movie. Thoroughly enjoy the movie"
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Spy was so underrated. Jason Statham stole every scene he was in. Wish they make a sequel soon.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Didn’t expect to see NP at all much less as #1. I first saw it in a dollar theater not knowing anything about it and felt like a new person coming out of the theater. Movies like this are refreshing and give me hope for society and filmmaking.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Great list! I would have also included Pineapple Express and Tropic Thunder.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"The first ‘Kingsmen’ movie was a bit of a surprise. The second one, not so much"
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,The Second one just A trash
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg, @RITTLE ROUGE the story is not that good in part 2 but the action seen on that one is dope
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg, @RITTLE ROUGE  it's not that fucking bad.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Its not a comedy
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,but the fighting scene on the second one was dope
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Hey? What’s going on with you
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"I don’t know how big it was expected to be, but Tropic Thunder is probably the funniest movie I’ve ever seen."

funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Really?  That movie made me cringe watching it... It literally made me embarrassed to be of the same species as those who made the film and acted in it
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,That movie sucks
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Am I the only person on planet earth that DIDNT think napoleon dynamite was funny. I respect its influence and such but it never once made me laugh.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg, @TCY  i dont think its funny ethier its boring i give it a 1 because of the dance scene
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Game Night is one of my favorite comedies and I'm still trying to figure out how Spy got beat by The Martian for the Golden Globe best comedy

funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg, @version2media  watch the  movie again ...
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg," @version2media  don't know if you speak the language, but her dad specifically told the other parents on atleast 2 separate occasions that he was very aware of the fact that his daughter was gay."
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"I took my nephews to se Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle and I was waiting to hate it lots, but I got surprised because it was so entertaining and easy to watch and enjoy. The last one was good too."
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,How is the hangover not #1. No one expected that hit to be made.. crazy
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Or Superbad
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,That wasn't the title of the video. They had an all star cast. I see certain actors & I just assume the movie will be good.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg, @Chechino  what? Superbad was getting credit just from the trailers. Everyone knew it was gonna be hilarious
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Zombieland 2 Double-tap is also pretty funny.  Decent franchise.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"Road trip, euro trip, grandmas boy, strange wilderness and blades of glory..the late 2000s were a treasure chest for stoney flicks.."
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,BRUH! EURO TRIP AND GRANDMA’S BOY! 🔥 thrrrowback
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"Strange Wilderness for sure!!!!! I didn't expect to laugh my ass off as much as I did during that one. Steve Zahn, Allen Covert & Justin Long were perfect. I still quote that movie with my brother."
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"21 and 22 Jump street were hilarious, also my in opinion Zombie Land is one of the more realistic zombie movies there is And the movie Let's Be Cops was funny"
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Napoleon dynamite was one of the first movies me and my brothers rented at blockbuster and to this day it cracks us up still 🤣😂
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Man Harold and kumar really brings back memories i used to watch them over and over
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Sometimes people can completely underestimate how good & funny some movies are these movies on this list proves that theory
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,I could literally feel napoleon dynamite at number 1. In my veins 😂😂😂
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"I would have included This is the end. Wasnt expecting much, but really enjoyed it"
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"Yep, me too, best comedy movie for me"
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,I thought for sure white chicks was going to be number one! Can't believe it's not on the list.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,This.
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Hey ? What’s going on with you
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Just finished watching Game Night! Great choice! Had fun hahaha
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"Girls trip is really underrated, I remember laughing my ass off every second"
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,This was a great list. One of your best. All of these movies surprised everyone and it's a reason I own almost all of them. Although I find Game Night a little overrated. Wasnt that funny

funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Road Trip! I thought it was going to be iight it ended up having me in tears. That milking the prostate scene imo is the funniest scene ever

Just the boy (later a 40 year old dude) that came before them. And years later it was everyone who played Jumanji when it became a video game. But the brother and sister were literally one of the few people we ever saw who did NOT get 'sucked in'."

funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,"I know its not the best time to mention ""white chicks"" for all the racial jokes but that film got the lowest reviews and still became a classic"
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,The problem I have with Mean Girls is it might as well be a rebooted version of heathers which is better murder in it
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,Bridesmaids is an Honorable mention?  Definitely should’ve been number one
funny movies recommend,7YxRZu7ICgg,How about American Pie?  No one should have predicted that instant classic.

healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"""Hachi : a dog's tale"" is almost impossible not to cry"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I know this sounds so stupid but I'm kinda scared to watch that because I have heard it is so sad. I still have never watched Marley and me..even though I love Jennifer Aniston! I just know I'll be bawling 🤦‍♀️
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I started watching this on Amazon Prime and when I came back to finish it they'd made it pay to view. My go to sad dog movie is A Dog's Purpose
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8, @Zoey x  oh that happened to me on a series I was watching! So annoying!
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I cried so hard watching this movie. It broke my heart.
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"My favorite sad dog movie is ""The Art of Racing In the Rain"".  I strongly recommend it."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,YESSSSSSSSS
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I bawled my eyes out to Hachi (it didn’t help that I was 8 months pregnant and highly emotional)
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,So true!
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Baby listen I thought about that dog the next dam day! That movie took me out!
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8, @K.C. Fahel  this is the one!
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Also, I even bawled Coco last scene where Miguel plays and sings for her before saying, ""your papa loved you very much"" 😭😭😭😭😭😭"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Oh that wrecks me!  But at the end,  she is with her mom and dad, and the family keeps going, so it is a nostalgic cry for me."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,yes that was so emotional. mama coco is sooo cute
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,i couldn't stop crying🥺
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I cry every single time. Ugly crying.
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Coco is number 1 for me, gets me good every time!"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"What about the ending to Shadow the Hedgehog (2005) the opening 40 seconds of"" Never Turn Back"". Makes me well up with tears. also makes me feel a little happy inside."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8, @bard the nascar fanatic dragon  I havent seen Sonic the Hedgehog.
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8," @Rio Toews  you mean shadow the hedgehog? it's a video game from 2005. I said that because of ""Never Turn Back."""
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8, @bard the nascar fanatic dragon  ohhh okay yeah I don't think I have played it lol sorry
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8, @Rio Toews  never turn back is the closing song.

healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,you are a saver thank you
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Thank you so much!!!
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Life saver. Dropped this 👑👑👑
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Thanks a lot for this
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,The fault in our stars made me cry for real 😳
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Thanks a lot 🙏
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,“I wish I knew how to quit you” 🥺 That line just hits different
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,jack fucking twist broke my heart
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I agree, Jake and Heath are such fantastic, charismatic actors, and that line hits me right in the feels! 😭"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,what movie you guys are talking about?what is its name?
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8, @BeetleJuice  brokeback mountain
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Brokeback Mountain is such a beautifully written tragic love story... Amazing acting by Jake & Heath, beautifully shot, and masterfully crafted by the amazing Ang Lee."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,❤️❤️❤️
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,It truly does
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"""Titantic"" never fails to make me weep. When Rose utters ""I'll never let go, Jack, that's my cue to bawl uncontrollably! 😭💔"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Agreed. Such a beautiful line from a heartbreaking epic.
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"The she LETS go! As a younger girl watching I was like ""you let him...go"" yt growing up, wiser you get the significance of that line. She will never let him go.....from her heart. 💕💔"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8," @Kerry Ann  Too true, you never really forget your first love. I did feel a little sorry for Rose's deceased husband, though, since she'd presumably lived a long and happy life with him as well."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,she could’ve moved over 🙄✋🏽
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"and the fact that he doesn't necessarily mean never let go of him, but to never let go of her freedom and lust for life"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8, @Nikki B  yeah I got the film ending much clearer as I watched it as I got older. When I was young and seen it I took it a bit too literal! 🤣
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,When I saw it I laughed at that part because she says she never let go and then does. But I cried at the very end when rose dies and goes back to jack in the ship along with all the other people that died.
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8, @celestedits  24 years later and people are still talking about that controversy.
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I felt so bad bc i laughed when i watched it
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I cant believe the notebook isnt even an honourable mention. That film gets me every time😭😭
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I am always a blubbering mess after watching The Notebook. Even though I know whats going to happen.  Apart from A Bridge to Terabithia the others on the list just seemed a bit meh
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I haven't watched the entire video yet, I guessed it would be right at the top. There's plenty of movies I wished were on the list.The Other Side of the MountainBrian's SongSomething for JoeyThe ChampI could go on and on."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,This video should be called “10 movies that are great but you’ll never want to watch again”
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I mean, the sad news is... I've watched A Walk To Remember more times than I can count."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Some of these movies I've watched multiple times. I've watched A Walk To Remember more than most movies, and I saw Titanic 3 times just in the cinema!"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,When you've watched basically all the movies on this list.
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8," @Zoey x  You don't WANT to know how many times I've seen ""Titanic""!  I've only seen 6 of the ones listed here (including HMs), and I've seen each and every one of the 6 more than twice."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"soo, i havent watched titanic at all. Should i watch it even knowing the ending?"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Oh I will still watch them regardless if they make me cry or not. Like Titanic I always cry during that movie and I still watch it
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8, @Hisyam Hasbi Ahmadinnahar  of course !
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,you don't have to but do a a movies we hate list
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I watched HACHI every years 🥺
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Five Feet Apart should be in the honorable mentions at least, it simply destroyed me"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Meh
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Yesss
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"See buddy, when i watched that movie, a cried and boy i cried my shit out"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I'm such a emotional wreck when it comes to The Green Mile, My Girl and anything with dying dogs! 🤦‍♀️ cry like baby!"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Me too, I'm extremely sensitive, and easily bawl at EVERYTHING! ""My Girl"" is the biggest offender! 💔😢"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8," @Trina Q  aww it shows we are human 💕💔. Ghost is another, so much more  now after Patrick's passing."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8," @Kerry Ann  Seconded, I watched that movie again recently, and still teared up at Patrick descending into the light. 😭"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8, @Trina Q  sometimes I wish my mum did what phoebe's mum did in Friends and switched the film off before it got to the sad part. 🤣. Actually the first time I seen ET the vhs tape messed and I didnt see the end.....the last I seen was him really poorly....😢😢.. so it took me  awhile of my sister convincing me he lived to watch it again. (She had seen it before) I still cried he went home but least he was alive lol
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8," @Kerry Ann  Ditto, why do children's films always have disturbingly heartbreaking content?! Despite knowing that ET is resurrected, it's still upsetting seeing him so sickly. Even worse, was that Drew Barrymore stated that she wasn't acting, she genuinely HATED seeing poor ET near death! 😭💔"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8," @Trina Q  oh my God I didnt know that about Drew. You're right though, what is with disney too, always killing off a parent? So brutal! 💔😢"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8," @Kerry Ann  Exactly, it seems to be an unofficial requirement for main characters in Disney movies to have either a deceased parent, or a parent who dies during the story."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8," @Trina Q  how we are not scarred for life I'll never know! I think Thomas J was the first human I cried over....before that though there was a fair few animal movies I'd cried over.  Turner and Hooch for example, and Bambi broke my heart! 💔"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8," @Kerry Ann  Yep, I can't believe that they DARED to kill off Macaulay Culkin, of all people! 😭 ""Return to Oz"" and ""Watership Down"" also scarred me, yet they were ostensibly for children!"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8, @Trina Q  oh my goodness. Watership Down....another heartbreaker right there! We sound like we are very similar in what gets us.....like really gets us!  Emotional wrecks lol. I'm glad it's not just me.🤗🤦‍♀️🤣
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,The Boy in the Striped Pajamas. I can never forget sobbing my eyes out to that movie.
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I just commented on that one after not seeing it, and here it is. It made me completely sad and feeling a bit uneasy about our species."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I just recorded that movie because I haven't seen it in years. I just have to prepare myself first. It's playing on HBO and just found out it's on Hulu too, incase you want to see it again."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Movie name
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,For me it will always be 'Marley and me'.I've just lost a dog which was with us for 9 years :( The sadness is beyond.
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I feel thatI cried for our dog when it died
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Is it just me or I don’t cry watching titanic 😂😂
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I didn't either
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Me neither, I never liked that movie"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,me too
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I didn’t cried
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8, @Trish’s Adventure in Life  cry
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I feel ""Life is beautiful"" deserves much higher position on this list. That movie is devestating!! I watched it as a teenager and it took me several days to recover emotionally 😳🙄"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Toy Story 3 is the most saddest movie ever of Pixar when we can see Andy saying Goodbye his toys and Woody he say Goodbye Cowboy give us the saddest and prettiest moment ever ever in the animation movie
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"""A walk to remember"" always breaking my heard 💔"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I love 'Me Before You' the best love story ever!
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I've waited two weeks for this list just so I know Hatchi can get the recognition it deserves.
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Why do I cry during every movie about a dog? Hachi: a dog's tale A Dog's purpose and A Dog's JourneyMarley and me 🤧
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Me too!! Legit like EVERY dog movie where the dog dies or something I start hysterically balling my eyes out!! 💯😭💔😕🐾Homeward Bound and Fox & The Hound gets me too along with the ones you said
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Eight Below
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Where The Red Fern Grows 🥺💔😞
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Saving Private Ryan to me has plenty of emotional moments from the start to end that blends a perfect balance of sad and respect.  With the song Hymn to the Fallen playing adds that mood. James ""Tell her that when you found me that I was here and I was with the only brothers I had left. There is no reason I would abandon them."" When an old James Ryan speaks to Captain Miller and asks his wife ""Tell me that I led a  good life. Tell me that I am a good man!"""
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"""Marley & Me"" and ""Toy Story 3"" both made my mom cry. ""Titanic"" is of my all-time favorites. Also, the ending of ""Driving Miss Daisy"" made me cry so much."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,My best friend and I went to see Me Before You at the brand new Movie Tavern when it first came out. We left the movie theater SOBBING and the poor waiter asked us if we were ok. We both gave a blubbering “Noooo” as we quickly left the theater 😂😂😂😂😂😂
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"When I went to see it, I could hear all the other people crying along with me."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I always bawl like a baby whenever I watch Hachi and Marley & me. I even  teared up  watching the clips just now.
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I’m in tears the last 15-20 minutes of Titanic every time, but when Rose says “I’ll never let go, I promise” I’m sobbing uncontrollably."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,10. Me before you.9. A walk to remember.8. Titanic.7. Bridge to Tarabethia.6. Brokeback Mountain.5. Life is beautiful.4. The fault in our stars.3. Marley and me.2. The green mile.1.Toy story 3.
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Thank you
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"That's what i love about these movies, they have such emotional scenes and music in them that not even i can resist shedding a tear!"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I cried like a baby when Gus told Hazel Grace that his cancer is back he went for a check up and his body lit up like a Christmas tree. I honestly didn't see it coming. I tear up thinking about it now even.
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Watching ""Marley & me"" i thought i would laugh , but ended up making me cry a lot"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"My brother cried 3 times during the movie. When the movie was done he said ""I'm not watching that movie again, it's too sad."""
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"I teared up just watching the scenes for A Walk to Remember, Bride to Terabithia and Marley and Me so I'd definitely say that they're tear jerkers!"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Up is the prettiest and saddest animation movie of Pixar in all the time the Story is cute and saddest and the characters are cool and funny
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"A lot of Nicolas Sparks’ movies made me cry, not only “Walk to remember”, but also “The Last Song” or “The Best of Me”. I believe, that Coco should be mentioned, by the end I was crying a lot..."
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"What Dreams May Come, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, too"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,On Inside Out by Disney/Pixar as the scene when Joy saw the good memories from the balls as she tries to make Riley's joyful until she cries just gets to me. 😭
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"Good collection of films. I'd even add The Notebook, Love Story, P.S. I Love You,  Boys Don't Cry and Blue Valentine. I also loved Gone With The Wind...it bring tears to the eye at the doomed love story of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler"
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,Blue valentine was hard to watch just seen now their life fell apart man that got me
healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,I watched hachi twice and still makes me cry.

healing movies recommend,6XcJP08Qva8,"A walk to remember my ultimate favourite movie of all time, I watched it more than 10 times and I'm still crying on it over and over, I just can't 😭😭😭"
